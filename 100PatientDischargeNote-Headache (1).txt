CHEST - PORTABLE AP ([**2141-3-16**]): Comparison is made to [**2-6**], [**2141**]. The patient is status post sternotomy. The tip of the central venous line terminates at the cavoatrial junction in a similar location. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. The lungs are clear. However, there is evidence of a small right subpulmonic effusion, new since the prior study. There is also similar fullness of the pulmonary vessels bilaterally, consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension. . ECG: Atrial fibrillation with somewhat rapid ventricular response. Since the previous tracing of [**2141-2-13**] atrial fibrillation is a new rhythm. The rate is somewhat faster. Otherwise, no significant change. . FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT PORT ([**2141-3-17**]): [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color, and pulse Doppler examination of the right femoral vessels was performed. Markedly turbulent, increased flow is seen in the right femoral vein with arterialization of the venous waveform demonstrated on pulse Doppler examination. There is a large groin hematoma measuring at least 18.5 x 7.9 x 8.3 cm. . FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT ([**2141-3-18**]): Grayscale, color, and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral artery and vein were performed. Again demonstrated is pulsatility of the right common femoral venous waveform with markedly elevated velocities of 180 cm/s consistent with an arteriovenous fistula. Redemonstrated within the right medial groin is a heterogeneous collection measuring at least 8.9 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm. These findings are consistent with a hematoma which appears more organized than on prior exam. Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the MICU service for close observation. At the time of admission to the ICU, the patient's SBP was stable ~100. There was concern for sepsis, [**2-16**] to an indwelling dialysis line, and the patient was covered with Vancomycin. He had a h/o of GIB in the past but his Hct remained stable and no evidence of active bleeding on exam. His BP responded to a 500cc bolus and remained stable. He was noted to be in an atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, requiring max diltiazem gtt and IV lopressor at one time. He was transitioned over to diltiazem and lopressor PO. With improvement in his rate, his blood pressure remained stable. The patient was noted to have a R groin hematoma, thought to be [**2-16**] to line attempts on admission. U/S revealed an AV fistula. Vascular Surgery was consulted and recommended holding pressure and repeating ultrasound. Repeat u/s following day showed no flow. . He remained hemodynamically stable and was called out to a monitored telemetry bed on the medical floor. There, a history of preceding diarrhea was elicited. Stool samples were sent for C Diff toxin assay, which returned positive on [**2141-3-22**]. The remainder of his workup remained negative, including blood cultures, chest X-ray, and [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. His presenting hypotension was presumed secondary to hypovolemia from C Diff associated diarrhea. He was started on PO Flagyl, with good symptomatic response. He was discharged with plans to complete a 2 week course. . He continued to be followed by the renal dialysis team and received dialysis on a MWF schedule. He was continued on Nephrocaps and received Epogen at dialysis. A temporary left internal jugular dialysis catheter was placed on [**2141-3-22**]. This was changed to a permanent tunnelled line on [**2141-3-28**]. . He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor twice daily for a recent history of gastrointestinal bleed. For this reason, he was not anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation. He received subcutaneous heparin three times daily for DVT prophylaxis.

Service: NEUROLOGY Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Headache and speech difficulties Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none History of Present Illness: 77 yo old right handed man who was transferred by [**Location (un) **] from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital after having an increasing headache while at home and finding an ICH on CT scan. Mr. [**Known lastname **] states that he was talking with a friend and the friend was asking for money to borrow when he felt the gradual onset of a left frontal squeezing headache. The headache increased in intensity over the next few minutes until it was unbearable. He took his blood pressure at home and the systolic was 225. He had not noticed any associated symptoms at that time, no weakness, no difficulty speaking or understanding. He drove himself (around 10 miles) to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. While in the ED he was documented as having difficulty understanding commands and was repeating questions such as "just tell me what you want me to do".

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2181-10-28**] 10:22 PM PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart size is mildly enlarged and the aorta is tortuous. Diffuse aortic calcifications are noted. Pulmonary vascularity is normal, and the hilar contours are unremarkable. There is minimal atelectasis at the lung bases. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized. IMPRESSION: Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. . CTA HEAD/NECK W&W/OC & RECONS Study Date of [**2181-10-28**] 10:40 PM CT: No significant interval change in left parietal/occipital lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, measuring up to 3.2 x 5.5 cm in the axial plane. New intraventricular hemorrhagic extension with minimal blood products layering in both occipital horns of the lateral ventricles. No midline shift or central herniation. No acute large vascular territorial infarction. CTA head/neck: No evidence of large vessel occlusion, flow limiting stenosis, or aneurysm greater than 2mm involving the cervical or intracranial anterior or posterior arterial circulations. No arteriovenous malformation identified. Dominant left vertebral artery with hypoplastic right vertebral artery. . CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2181-10-30**] FINDINGS: There is a large parenchymal hematoma involving the left posterior temporal, parietal and occipital lobes, which is not significantly changed in size. Mild surrounding edema is unchanged in extent. There is slightly more blood in the occipital horns and atria of the lateral ventricles. The left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is compressed, as before. Overall, the ventricles are stable in size. There is no shift of normally midline structures. Multiple foci of low density are again seen in the subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter, most suggestive of sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in a patient of this age. Intracranial arterial calcifications are again noted. The imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. IMPRESSION: Stable large left temporal/occipital/parietal parenchymal hematoma with slightly increased intraventricular extension. Stable mass effect. . MRI/MRV HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2181-10-29**] 11:18 AM FINDINGS: Again seen is a 5.2 (AP) x 2.8 cm (TRV) intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left temporoparietal regions. The overall size of the lesion appears unchanged from the prior exam. Given the lobar distribution of the hemorrhage this is likely related to amyloid angiopathy. However, seen within the center of the lesion are multiple foci of enhancement with the largest measuring 0.7 x 0.6 cm (102b:42). Although these are located centrally, it could be suggestive of active extravasation or enhancement of an underlying lesion such as a malignancy or AVM. Given that the surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity does not involve the adjacent [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, an infarction would be less likely. Evaluation of the MRV reveals no evidence for venous thrombosis. There is a hypoplastic left venous system, which, although not well visualized on the time-of-flight sequence, does opacify with contrast on the MP-RAGE sequence. Blood is again seen within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles but with no evidence for hydrocephalus. An incidental developmental venous anomaly is seen within the right parietal lobe. There is no shift of the normally midline structures seen and, other than the previously described lesion, there are no additional areas of abnormal enhancement or diffusion. The lenses and globes are normal. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for venous thrombosis. 2. Large left temporo-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with central enhancing foci. Again, this is suggestive of either active extravasation or enhancing underlying lesion. However, given the lobar distribution this appears to be sequela to amyloid angiopathy. Followup is recommended. . . Cardiology: Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2181-10-29**] at 10:08:02 AM Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are moderately dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Dilated thoracic aorta. [**2181-11-1**] Cerebral Angiography: No AVM or dural fistula noted. Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old right handed man with HTN, AF not anticoagulated, CAD with previous CABG ([**2170**]) who presented with an acute headache w/ significant hypertension, found to have a L temporo-parietal IPH on CT at an OSH. On initial exam, he had significant aphasia, alexia w/out agraphia, complete anomia, with retained ability to follow commands and fluent but frequently halting speech. He had no agraphesthesia, sensory loss, and full motor strength throughout. On visual field exam, he was noted to have a right upper quadrantanopia, which was consistent with the location of his brain lesion. His blood pressures were significantly elevated on admission to neuro ICU [**2181-10-28**] so he was started on IV nicardipine infusion. At this time, CT showed no significant interval change in the ICH, which measured 3.2 x 5.5 cm in the axial plane with new intraventricular extension and dominant left vertebral artery with hypoplastic right vertebral artery. MRI/MRV showed some contrast enhancemenet in the area of the bleed and MRV showed no venous sinus thrombosis. Echo showed mild symmetric LVH with EF>55% and mild-moderate MR, evidence of pulmonary HTN, a dilated 4cm thoracic aorta, and no evidence of atrial mass or thrombus. As he was stable, he was transferred to the stepdown unit on [**10-29**]. He arrived on the floor in stable condition and converted to home meds. Aspirin and s/c heparin were initially held given the risk of hemorrhagic expansion. Soon after conversion to home meds, his blood pressure became difficult to control, requiring uptitration of his home mediations (lisinopril and metoprolol) and the addition of 5mg of amlodipine. This regimen was able to keep his SBP between 120-140. He also spiked a temperature of 100.9, prompting infectious workup involving blood cultures, urine cultures, and CXR all of which were unrevealing. On [**10-30**], he continued to have a low grade fever and appeared more somnolent, prompting a repeat CT which showed a stable hematoma with slight increase in intraventricular expansion. On [**11-1**] he developed a right eye conjunctivitis, which was promptly treated with ciprofloxacin ophth soln with rapid improvement. This was thought to be the origin of his low grade fevers. Otherwise, his infectious workup was unrevealing-- CXR x2 were negative, urine and blood cultures had no growth. He had a mild leukocytosis. He received at formal angiogram on [**11-1**] which did not show any evidence of AVM or dural fistula or aneurysm. His IPH was thought to be the result of amyloid angiopathy. IT is possible that it is the result of hypertension. Clinically, over the course of hospital stay, his speech improved but he persisted in having marked expressive aphasia and anomia. He was evaluated by Speech/swallow and was found to tolerate regular foods. PT and OT also evaluated him and found him to be ataxic and therefore recommended rehabilitation. On discharge to rehab, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was in good condition and seemed to be in high spirits. His son, however, notes that his father has poor insight into his condition and reports a history of steady decline marked by a significant loss of physical ability. As Mr. [**Known lastname **] currently lives alone, his son is currently consider [**Hospital3 **] and other options after rehabilitation. = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ Transitional issues: 1. Intraparenchymal bleed: thought [**1-24**] amyloid angiopathy. He was started on low dose aspirin given his stable condition. He he was to worsen clinically, further imaging should be performed to rule out further bleeding. HE will have Neurology follow up at [**Hospital1 18**]. 2. HTN: he had difficult to control BP post- stroke requiring uptitration of his BP meds and addition of amlodipine. He might require further titration of these meds (either up or down) in the near future. 3. Intermittent low grade temperature/ mild leukocytosis: He had conjuctivitis which was treated with ciprofloxacin drops. He had no clear source of infection with negative blood cultures/negative urine cultures/negative CXR. If he continues to be afebrile, he will require further workup for infectious etiologies.

CT abd/pelv [**11-12**]: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions. 2. Right basal lung consolidation. 3. Moderate ascites. CXR [**11-12**]: Bilateral lower lobe opacities, possibly representing aspiration or atelectasis. Bilateral effusions are likely. CXR [**11-13**]: Basal densities developing over the last two days and are suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions. Complete PA and lateral chest view is recommended for further confirmation of the somewhat subtle findings. A previous abdominal chest CT of [**2149-11-12**], included images of the basal portions of the lungs disclosed bilateral pleural effusions as well as some atelectasis in the dependent portion of the posterior segments. This finding is consistent with findings observed on the single portable chest view, which however, cannot present same detail as the CT examination. CXR [**11-14**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**11-13**]. Minimal interstitial edema persists along with left lobe atelectasis. No findings to suggest pneumonia. A paucity vessels in the upper lobes suggest emphysema. Heart size is normal and midline. No pneumothorax. RLE LENI [**11-15**] 6am: This examination had suboptimal images of the superficial femoral vein and was repeated. RLE LENI [**11-15**] 12pm: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity. Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 56yo man with h/o poorly controlled DM admitted with DKA secondary to medication non-adherence in the setting of depression. Hospital course is reviewed below by problem: 1. DKA - The patient was started on an insulin drip per standard protocol for ~30 hours. His anion gap closed, and he was started on NPH at 15u [**Hospital1 **] given his poor PO intake (on 25u [**Hospital1 **] at home). After adjustment during his hospital stay, he was discharged on 25 units NPH qam and 18 units NPH qhs. 2. Leukocytosis - The patient presented with a WBC of 24. This was initially thought to be a stress reaction similar to that evidenced in a prior admission, but after one blood culture grew E coli he was started on levofloxacin and flagyl. The remainder of the blood cultures were positive, including the other 3 from that day, and he had no source of infection, nor was he febrile. As such, the levofloxacin was continued only for a 7 day course for possible pneumonia (CXR with unclear basal opacities on initial read). Flagyl was discontinued given the culture results of E coli. His WBC trended down and was normal at discharge. 3. ARF - He was admitted with a Cr of 3.2, a similar elevation to his last admission for DKA. This was most likely secondary to dehydration from the hyperglycemia. He was aggressively hydrated with IVF and his Cr was 0.7 on discharge. 4. Hyperkalemia - On admission, he had peaked T waves on ECG and a K of 8.3. His hyperglycemia was treated with IVF and insulin, and he received calcium for the hyperkalemia. This resolved and was within normal limits once his anion gap closed. 5. CV - He had a h/o cardiomyopathy, but not CAD. He had no evidence of active ischemia during this admission. He was discharged on home regimen of ASA and lisinopril. Outpatient echo was recommended to re-assess his LVEF. 6. H/o EtOH - The patient denied recent EtOH use. He had no evidence of withdrawal. 7. Socioeconomic issues - The social worker was extensively involved in this hospitalization. At discharge, Pharmacare had been contact[**Name (NI) **] to waive the copay for his prescriptions and he was notified of this. He was given information about the resources available to him for aid and instructed on how to contact the agencies involved. 8. Code status - full. 9. depression- a major contributor to his original presentation. Pt requested an inpatient psychiatric consultation, which was obtained.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 55 year old female with a history of reactive airway disease and asthma that has required multiple past hospitalizations/intubations who was now admitted for asthma exacerbation in the setting of new pneumonia that was resolving upon transfer from the ICU to the medicine floor. She had community acquired pneumonia/bronchitis possibly exposed since her husband had a recent upper respiratory infection. Her chest xray at transfer showed a left lower lobe infiltrate. She was afebrile during her stay on the medicine floor with a mildly elevated white cell count. She received a ten day course of levoquin. The pneumonia triggered an asthma exacerbation for which she received a steroid taper and frequent albuterol/ipatropium nebulizer respiratory therapy. At discharge she was breathing comfortably at her baseline respiratory status and planned to continue home nebulizer therapy, a steroid taper, and to finish the course of levoquin. She has a demyelinating syndrome of unknown etiology and was continued on her regular regiment of baclofen and klonopin. She had two episodes of muscle stiffness that was relieved by ativan. The patient was continued on her home IV steroid supplementation for adrenal insufficiency, continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and her statin for hypercholesterolemia. At discharge, the patient was comfortably eating a regular diet and speaking easily without oxygen supplementation. She was afebrile with baseline labs and has follow up arranged as an outpatient and will continue respiratory therapy at home.

CHEST PAIN - On admission, the patient had chest pain that resolved with morphine. Troponin was 0.04 (with CRI) with concerning EKG (lateral ST changes). The patient was started on lovenox (patient refused q6 PTT checks making heparin inappropriate). The patient refused cardiac cath or any other intervention. She was continued on maximal medical management. An ECHO 1 month ago at [**Hospital1 112**] showed an EF 55%. A ECHO on admission here showed a new reduced EF of 35%. The patient was managed medically. She again complained of CP on the day prior to d/c but continued to refuse all interventions. Her EKG continued to show lateral/inferior TWI c/w her presentation. Her troponins were 0.01 on discharge and never elevated beyond 0.04 on admission. She was managed medically with a beta blocker which can be titrated up as her blood pressure allows - on discharge she is on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], with BP ranging from 90-120 systolic. An ACE-I was not started secondary to a reported "allergy" in the past. She is on ASA 325 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily. Provided the patient continues to refuse intervention, nitroglycerin can be attempted for chest pain relief. An oral nitrate could also be considered. 2. HYPOTENSION - The patient was hypotensive on admission. She was not responding well to fluid bolues and a MICU consult was called. They recommended transfer to the ICU, but the patient was refusing central line placement and other ICU level care so she was kept on the general medicine floor. Her hypotension was thought secondary to infection (WBC 20/Lactate 2.7) and she was started on linezolid/axtreonam (multiple resistence organisms in the past with pen/ceph/tobra allergies). Blood/Urine/Stool cultures were sent. She was maintained on NS overnight and her blood pressure stabalized. Her original CXR did not show any acute pulmonary process. A repeat CXR showed a possible LLL opacity. A PA+Lat was performed for better visulalization of the opacity. The patient refused a PICC making antibiotic choice difficult. Later, her antibiotic coverage was changed to Levofloxacin. She had two other episodes of hypotension on this admission with SBP to the 80's. These other episodes were thought to be due to hight ostomy output and responded well to 1 liter normal saline fluid boluses. Left upper extremity PICC placed on [**11-21**] for hydration and electrolyte repletion. She completed her course of levaquin in house. Her urine subsequently grew out Klebsiella and E. Coli, resistant to multiple drugs. Antibiotic selection was further complicated by her penicillin allergy, and ID recommended transfer to the ICU for meropenem desensitization which was completed on [**2204-12-3**]. On day of discharge she is on day 3 of meropenem, and should complete a 2 week course ending on [**2204-12-16**]. 3. COPD: The patient was continued on flovent and nebulizer treatments. Initially, she required 3-4L O2 (increased from home 2LO2) though possibly secondary to fluid overload or COPD flare. She was started on steroids in the setting of her ICU admission for hypotension, and these were continued via a slow taper as it was thought they may have improved her COPD. Eventually, she stabilized on 1-2L NC. She is on 40 mg Prednisone daily on the day of discharge ([**12-5**]). She should receive 1 more day of 40 mg and then 3 days of 20 mg, 3 days of 10 mg, 3 days of 5 mg, then off. 4. CRI: Her creatinine was elevated on admission at 2.1. This eventually trended down to normal with hydration. Her electrolytes were repleted as necessary. 5. HYPONATREMIA: The patient has long standing hyponatremia, most likely due to dehydration. She was admitted with a Na of 128 and this normalized with hydration. 6. SHORT GUT SYNDROME: She was continued on a lactose free diet. Initially, her bismuth and loperimide were held for the possibility of infectious colitis. Stool cultures were sent for c. diff and returned negative. She was also tested for giardia which was negative. C. Diff B toxin was sent and found to be negative. She continued to have high output from her ostomy. A PICC was placed for hydration and electrolyte repletion. Further work-up was initiated with stool studies including giardia/camphylobacter/OP were all negative. GI was also consulted and reccommended dietary changes (low fat/carb/lactose, small freq feedings), anti-motility agents (immodium, cholestyramine), and also suggested that her ostomy output may be w/in the normal range for a patient w/ a total colectomy. The patient's ostomy output declined in the days prior to d/c and ranged from 700-1500cc/day with formed stool. . 7. CODE: The patient was full code at the time of admission. After a discussion with the patient, she decided to change her status to DNR/DNI. 8. PPX: Protonix, SC heparin.

Service: MEDICINE Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsive, respiratory distress Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None History of Present Illness: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of dementia, multiple ischemic strokes, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic CHF who was found unresponsive in bed at her nursing home. She was not responsive to voice and only minimally responsive to sternal rub. She was noted to be in respiratory distress with tachypnea and desaturation on RA, and was placed on a NRB. She was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. She has a documented DNI/DNR order. . In the ED, initial vital signs were T 96.9, BP 110/73, HR 130, RR 24, SpO2 100% on 15L NRB. She had an unremarkable head CT with only no acute process noted. Portable CXR showed a LLL opacity concerning for infection, and her WBC count was elevated to 16.4 with 79.3% neutrophils and no bands. UA showed WBC 13, small leuk esterase, and no bacteria. Her Troponin was slightly elevated to 0.05, and EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 135 bpm with left axis deviation and no acute ischemic changes. Oral secretions were cleared with suction. She was given Vancomycin 1000 mg IV and Zosyn 4.5 grams IV. She received a total of 700 ml IV fluids. For her atrial fibrillation, she received a total of Diltiazem 40 mg IV with good response in her heart rate and stable blood pressure. She was admitted to the ICU given her continued oxygen requirement. Vitals prior to transfer were T afebrile, HR 103, BP 97/47, RR 27, SpO2 98% on 15L. . Once in the ICU, she remained unresponsive to voice and would only withdraw from painful stimuli. She was in mild respiratory distress with tachypnea and appeared uncomfortable. Her son was [**Name (NI) 653**] and her code status was confirmed as DNR/DNI. He will be coming in to the ICU tomorrow. . Review of Systems: Unable to obtain due to patient mental status.

Occasionally will turn to voice. Otherwise, does not withdrawl to pain and does not follow commands. Remainder of exam is unchanged except heart rate was well controlled at time of discharge. Pertinent Results: ==================== Imaging: ==================== # CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2166-8-22**] at 12:32 PM): FINDINGS: A portable semi-upright view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated and low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Left lower lung consolidatoin may be a combination of atelectasis and effusion, although infection cannot be excluded. The heart is enlarged. Aortic knob calcifications are seen. The right lung is clear without pneumothorax or effusion. No acute osseous abnormality is identified. IMPRESSION: Left lower lung consolidation may be a combination of telectasis and effusion, but infection cannot be excluded. PA and lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation. . # CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2166-8-22**] at 12:38 PM): FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or major vascular territorial infarcts. Prominent ventricles and sulci are compatible with moderate global age-related volume loss. Hypoattenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter is likely sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Bilateral basal ganglia calcifications are noted. There is no shift of normally midline structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved. No acute osseous abnormality is identified. Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses. The mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Significant global age related volume loss and chronic microvascular ischemic disease change. . CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2166-8-26**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion has moderately increased. The effusion now occupies approximately 50% of the left hemithorax. No right pleural effusion. There is mild cardiomegaly with signs of minimal overhydration. No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities. Extensive left lower lobe atelectasis. ==================== Micro: Blood and urine cultures negative with exception of yeast from urine culture from admission. . ==================== DISCHARGE LABS: [**2166-8-31**] 06:45AM BLOOD WBC-5.8 RBC-3.63* Hgb-10.8* Hct-33.0* MCV-91 MCH-29.8 MCHC-32.7 RDW-13.1 Plt Ct-395 [**2166-8-31**] 06:45AM BLOOD Glucose-295* UreaN-27* Creat-1.1 Na-138 K-3.7 Cl-95* HCO3-31 AnGap-16 [**2166-8-31**] 06:45AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Mg-2.4 Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of dementia, multiple ischemic strokes, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic CHF who was found unresponsive in bed and in respiratory distress at her nursing home, likely due to a left lower lung pneumonia. . # Pneumonia, likely aspiration - She has a history of dementia and dysphagia and was receiving tube feeds through a percutaneous G tube. Given her acute presentation and history, an aspiration event was presumed to be the likely cause of her respiratory decompensation. She was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn in the ED, and required supplemental oxygen with a 15L NRB. She was continued on Vanc/Zosyn in the ICU. She completed an 8-day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**2166-8-29**]. . # Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure - On the medical floor, she had an acute decompensation, with increased respiratory distress, Afib with HR to 130's, and decreased breath sounds. She was presumed to be in acute diastolic heart failure, and was treated with IV lasix, IV diltiazem, as well as IV morphine and ativan for patient comfort given acute distress. With these interventions, pt's respiratory status stabilized. Her HR improved significantly, and she was started on low dose diltiazem to continue to help control her heart rate. She was continued on oral lasix. Her volume status should be monitored carefully. Also, would recommend that her electrolytes and creatinine are checked every few days and that her lasix be decreased if her creatinine increases. . # Atrial Fibrillation, with RVR - She was in RVR several times during her hospitalization and her nodal blockade was titrated. Her heart rate was very well controlled on diltiazem and metoprolol at the current doses (please see discharge medication list). . # ? upper GI bleed - On [**8-28**] she was noted by nursing to have bright red blood when her G-tube was suctioned. Tube feeds were held, she was started on an intravenous PPI drip and her hematocrit was trended. A conversation was held with her health care proxy who declined endoscopy or intervention. Ultimately, her hematocrit was trended and actually remained stable. Her proton pump inhibitor was changed to oral. Her tube feeds were restarted and she was tolerating them at full strength at the time of discharge without residuals or any evidence of bleeding. . # Mental Status Changes/ probable toxic metabolic encephalopathy: She has a history of dementia and prior strokes. Her baseline prior to the current admission was poor after her most recent stroke per her son, with aphasia and dysphagia noted in her records. Head CT on arrival did not show any acute process. During the admission, she was generally minimally responsive, and aphasic. She would occasionally orient towards voice but that was about the extent of her responsiveness. . # Troponin Leak: Her Troponin was elevated slightly to 0.05 on admission with no ischemic changes on EKG. This was most likely due to demand ischemia due to Afib with RVR. Troponins were followed and stably elevated 0.05. . # Nutrition: She is on tube feeds with Jevity 1.2 at 60 ml/hr at home through her G-tube. . # Diabetes Mellitus: Fingerstick checks Q6H. She was managed with a regular insulin sliding scale and this should be continued . # Goals of care: A family meeting was held with pt's son and healthcare proxy, [**Name (NI) 915**] [**Name (NI) **], on [**2166-8-26**], shortly after a period of acute decompensation. Palliative care was consulted and assisted with goals of care discussions. Per the discussion with [**Doctor Last Name 915**], future ICU transfers are not within patient's goals of care. Futhermore, we recommend further discussion with her nursing facility physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] it appears that the family is open to discussion about the possibility of no further hospitalizations, and instead pursuing comfort-directed care within the nursing home.

Noted to be more SOB that evening at rehab and transferred to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital where SBP 189/53, HR 110, O2 sat 99-100% on NRB. Started on nitro gtt, R femoral line placed, and intubated for ABG of 7.17/92/86. Labs notable for WBC 17.0 (67.2N, 0B), Hct 27.9, BNP 1555, Cr 1.7, CK 31, tropI 0.06 (nl < 0.10). EKG with J point elevation in V1-2 that was initially concerning for STEMI. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. . In the ED, Tm 99.2, BP initially 178/78 which improved after 1 inch nitropaste and uptitrating nitro gtt, O2 sat 100% on AC vent. Given ASA 325 mg X 1, cardiology called to review EKGs who thought EKGs were unremarkable for ACS. Admitted to MICU for further management after receiving solumedrol 125 mg IV X 1. Past Medical History: 1. Asthma/COPD - Recently admitted for a flare on [**2146-3-29**] and treated with nebulizers, steroids, and a course of azithromycin. Last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] in Pulmonology in [**Month (only) 547**], when he thought she was deconditioned from her time in the hospital although adequately medicated. Recommended a Cardiology consult at this time for what he believed to be significant diastolic dysfunction secondary to long-standing hypertension. 2. Paralyzed left hemidiaphragm s/p pericardial window procedure, performed per old cardiology notes for recurrent pericardial effusions. Pericardial biopsy c/w inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. [**Doctor First Name **] 1:40, dsDNA and RF negative. 3. Severe hypertension with diastolic dysfunction - Per PCP notes typically controlled in the 160's unless patient experiences an asthma flare when it shoots to 170's-180's. Notably systolic pressures were in the 130's during her last hospital admission, presumably the reason why her HCTZ and enalapril doses were halved. Patient is poorly compliant and most recently has not been taking her antihypertensives due to her ill son-in-law, unable to pick up her meds from the pharmacy. 4. Hyperlipidemia 5. Chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine around 1.4). 6. Polymyalgia rheumatica. 7. Osteoporosis. 8. Trigeminal neuralgia - reportedly seen by Optometry [**2146-4-26**] and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Last Name (STitle) 878**]. 9. Iron-deficient anemia 10. Gastritis Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] is a widow of many years and a mother of three. She lives in the bottom unit of a shared home with her daughter and son-in-law, who provide her with a large amount of care and support. Although Ms. B is able to complete most of her ADL's, she relies on her daughter for shopping and cooking. While she doesn't specifically say it, her increasing dependence on her children has taken a bit of its toll on her. This may be partially responsible for her decreased med compliance - the patient relies on others to go to CVS to pick up her meds. Her daughter had the flu prior to Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**]' hospitalization, and because of this, she was unable to pick up her medications on time. Additionally, it sounds as if the patient doesn't leave her house very often. She comments on how she doesn't like to walk outside or to sit on her porch. Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] would rather watch television, socializing with friends infrequently. Family History: Diabetes mellitus in siblings and children. No bleeding or clotting disorders.

Soft tissue anasarca. 2) Soft tissue density nodules along anterior abdominal wall, probably injection sites. CXR [**7-1**]: An ET tube and NG tube have been removed. A bronchial stent is identified. Right- sided PICC line tip terminates in the mid SVC. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. There is mild leftward mediastinal shift, persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, and retrocardiac opacity likely representing atelectasis. Consolidation cannot be excluded. Small right- sided pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis are unchanged. Upper extremity U/S [**7-2**]: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity. Limited evaluation of the peripheral segment of the right brachial vein due to overlying bandage. ECHO [**2146-7-4**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with severe global biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process. Mild mitral regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-2-7**], biventricular systolic function is new. CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2146-7-6**]: 1. Interval development of moderate amount of pelvic free simple fluid. 2. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. 3. Multiple renal cysts, some of which are simple and others which are hyperdense, as described above. These need follow up with US or MR in 6 months. 4. Aortic and vascular calcifications with focal displacement of aortic calcifications just above the aortic bifurcation which could represent calcified mural thrombus or intramural hematoma, unchanged. 5. Pneumopericardium. 6. Small right pleural effusion. ECHO [**2146-7-9**]: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-7-4**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is increased. Brief Hospital Course: OVERALL SUMMARY: 83 yo F with h/o COPD, asthma, HTN, diastolic CHF with recent admission for respiratory failure thought to be [**2-5**] COPD and CHF exacerbation who presented from rehab with SOB and respiratory failure requiring intubation and MICU admission. Initially extubated and weaned down to 2L NC. On day of planned discharge ([**2146-7-4**]) she had a PEA arrest. She was resuscitated with chest compressions and epinephrine, reintubated, and transferred back to the MICU. She was briefly hypotensive with intubation, but became hypertensive to the 170s-180s later during her hospital course which was managed with multiple oral and IV medications including nicardipine, labetalol (PO and IV), clonidine patch, nitro drip. She was extubated on [**7-7**] and continued to complained of significant anxiety, chest pain [**2-5**] compressions, and difficulty coughing up secretions. She had persistent respitatory difficulty requiring high flow mask on [**7-8**] and [**7-9**]. When initially admitted her code status was full. After family meeting on [**7-8**] she was switched to DNR/DNI. During the night of [**7-9**] she had an episode of bradycardia to the 30s, which resolved spontaneously. On the morning of [**7-10**], she was agitated and called for decreasing O2 saturation and increasing bradycardia. Nasal airway was placed and supplemental O2 was given but these did not increase O2 sats. Her O2 sat and heart rate continued to drop and she became bradycardic. The bradycardia transitioned to asystole, and she expired at 8:45am on [**2146-7-10**]. . <br> Respiratory failure: Initial respiratory failure at presentation most likely [**2-5**] COPD/asthma exacerbation and worsening of underlying diastolic CHF, especially as BPs elevated. Required intubation from [**6-27**] to [**6-28**]. Was treated for asthma/COPD/CHF exacerbation, extubated, and transferred to the floor. However on [**2146-7-4**] she had a PEA arrest likely [**2-5**] hypercarbic respiratory failure (ABG showed pH of ~7) and was resusciated, re-intubated and transferred back to the MICU. In the MICU she had persistent difficulty passing SBTs; a trial on [**7-6**] showed that she had small tidal volumes and extubation was delayed. On [**7-7**] she had a RISB of 67 and passed a SBT. She was extubated without difficulty. Post-extubation she complained of significant R chest pain which was treated with a lidocaine patch and fentanyl. She also complained of respiratory secretions which she had difficulty coughing up; she was treated with guaifenicin. She did well on a shovel mask most of the day [**7-7**] but in the evening desatted to the high 80s and was placed on a high flow mask with FiO2 of 40%. On [**7-8**] she complained of persistent difficulty coughing up secretions and also complained of significant anxiety. Respiratory difficulty continued through [**7-9**], though her O2 sats were generally in the 90s throughout this period. On [**7-10**] AM, her O2 sat dropped over the course of 15 minutes before she expired as per above. <br> COPD/Asthma: She was treated for COPD/asthma exacerbation throughout her hospital course (beginning on [**6-27**]) with a slow steroid taper. Her nebs, fluticasone, and cromolyn were continued during hospitalization. She had no other evidence of acute COPD exacerbation during her hospital course. . <br> HTN: She had a very labile BP in the setting of discontinuation of ACE-I due to ARF, hyperkalemia. Was controlled with increased dose of PO nicardipine and prn hydralazine, stabilized HD 3 on nifedipine 60mg q8h. At the time of re-intubation on [**7-4**] was briefly hypotensive, and her clonidine patch was discontinued, but then blood pressure continued to rise and she became hypertensive to the 170s-180s systolic. She was put back on her home clonidine patch as well as a nitro drip and nicardipine. Her blood pressures continued to spike intermittently to the 180s+ and a labetalol drip was started. She continued to exhibit intermittent episodes of hypertension and nitro and labetalol drips were needed intermittently, though the overall goal was to decrease the nitro drip as much as possible. Her ACEI was not able to be restarted as her creatinine was persistently above the baseline (her baseline is 1.6-2 and she ranged from 2.2-2.6 during second MICU admission). Her HTN had a significant anxiety component and she was given morpine once as well as ativan 0.5mg IV on 2 occasions to decrease anxiety. This did appear to help as when her anxiety was better controlled her BPs were also better controlled, but in general she was extremely labile. . <br> Cardiac: 1) CAD: Innitially she had EKG changes concerning for NSTEMI. Cardiology reviewed EKGs and felt she was not having ACS. Cardiac enzymes were stable from [**Date range (1) 7154**]. It was thought that EKG changes were likely due to LVH and J point elevation. Slightly increased troponin and CK post chest compressions on [**7-4**] later trended downwards on [**7-5**] and she was ruled out for MI. ASA and statin were continued throughout hospital course. 2) Pump: Known diastolic CHF, last baseline TTE in [**2-11**] revealed LVEF > 55%, PCWP > 18mmHg. Admitted and diuresed in MICU. After PEA, an echo showed a LVEF ~20% likely [**2-5**] the PEA. She was given lasix initially with the goal to keep a negative fluid balance. When she no longer showed clinical evidence of volume overload, lasix was used to keep fluid balance even. A repeat echo on [**7-9**] showed an LVEF of ~30% with global LV hypokinesis and significant pulmonic regurgitation. Her persistent low EF after PEA arrest is indicative that cardiac failure was likely one of the primary reasons for her death. 3) Rate: Remained in NSR. Slightly tachycardic as well as bradycardic at different points. Episode of bradycardia to the 30s on the night of [**7-9**], spontaneously resolved. Bradycardia starting the morning of [**7-10**] persisted until time of death. . <br> Trachobronchomalacia s/p Y stent placement on [**6-18**]. ETT tube was placed b/w stent and trachea, causing dyspnea / wheezes. Interventional pulmonary consulted after re-intubation on [**7-4**] and felt that the stent should be left in place until she was more stable. . <br> Acute on chronic renal failure Baseline Cr 1.6 - 1.9, was slightly elevated at initial [**6-27**] admission and at time of second MICU admission [**7-4**]. On [**7-5**] - [**7-6**] Cr continued to be elevated at 2.2. [**Date range (1) 1164**] Cr was elevated to 2.3. On [**7-9**] and [**7-10**] Cr was increasingly elevated at 2.6. Her ACEI was held at admission and was not restarted during her hospital course. <br> Anemia Has baseline iron deficiency of anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Hct was in mid 20s until [**7-5**], when it was 21 in the AM and 20.1 in the PM. She was transfused 1 unit of PRBC. Repeat Hct post-transfusion was 22.2. Hct morning of [**7-6**] was 21.1; repeat Hct in the PM was 20.9. She was transfused another 1 unit of PRBC. A CT of the abdomen showed moderate free fluid in the dependent pelvis but no retroperitoneal hematoma. Guaiacs were negative and labs showed no evidence of hemolysis. Hematocrit stabilized and rose to around 25-26 during the rest of her hospital stay. <br> FEN/GI NGT was placed, lytes were repleted PRN. Patient complained of abdominal pain on [**7-5**] which resolved by [**7-6**], though still complained of gas pains. Was given simethicone and pains resolved. Tube feeds were started on [**7-8**]. <br> Osteoporosis: Home Calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates were continued <br> Access: Femoral line was placed during the code [**7-4**] and removed on [**7-5**]. PICC line was placed on [**7-5**]. R Aline was placed on [**7-4**]. <br> PPX: Heparin SC/pneumoboots, colace, PPI, insulin SS <br> Code: FULL starting at initial admission; changed to DNR/DNI after family meeting on [**7-8**].

There is an additional more suble focal hypodensity in segment III of the liver which measures 8 mm in size. Neither hypodensity was appreciated on the patient's previous study of [**2111**]. Multiple gallstones are present. The spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys appear grossly unremarkable. There has been interval increase in size of a cystic lesion in the uncinate process. The aorta is tortuous, with circumferential atheromatous calcification extending into the iliac arteries. There is a saccular aneurysm at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus which measures 3.6 cm in diameter. There is no free fluid, free air or lymph node enlargement. PELVIS: There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon, without evidence of diverticulitis. The urinary bladder is partially distended. An uncomplicated small bowel containing right inguinal hernia is noted. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is moderate scoliosis with associated degenerative changes. There are scattered sclerotic foci in both iliac bones and within the approximate T9 vertebral body and left T11 pedicle, all of which are stable ([**2111**]) and suggestive of bone islands. IMPRESSIONS: 1. Increasing cystic lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas, for which an MRI is recommended to further characterize. 2. Hepatic hypodensities, as detailed above, which may represent focal fatty infiltration of the liver versus discrete hepatic lesions. These could also be further evaluated on MRI. 3. Cholelithiasis. 4. Diverticulosis, without additional findings of diverticulitis. 5. Uncomplicated small bowel containing right inguinal hernia. 6. Bilateral pleural effusions. . [**8-13**] TTE The left atrium and right atrium are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-3-27**], the rhythm now appears to be atrial fibrillation. Biventricular systolic function and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artrery systolic pressure are similar. Mitral regurgitation is no longer seen. . [**8-26**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 110. Left anterior hemiblock. Non-specific lateral repolarization changes. Cannot exclude old anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2114-8-22**] the ventricular response rate to atrial fibrillation is marginally faster. . SERIAL CXRs since admission; the CXR studies below highlight interval change: [**8-22**] CXR CHEST 1 VIEW: A right subclavian PICC line is again seen with its tip terminating in the upper SVC. Cardiac size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There are unchanged bilateral effusions right greater than left with associated atelectasis. IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged radiographic chest showing moderate pleural effusion on the right and small effusion on the left with associated atelectasis. . [**9-1**] CXR FINDINGS: Right-sided PICC is present, extending to the mid SVC. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged, with cardiomegaly and calcification seen of the aortic arch. There is unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and lung also appear essentially unchanged. . [**9-6**] CXR The right PICC line tip terminates in mid SVC. The heart size is markedly enlarged but unchanged. No significant change in mediastinal contour is present. The bilateral hilar enlargement most likely related to pulmonary artery dilatation, suggesting pulmonary hypertension. Bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left is again demonstrated, slightly increased on the right. No overt pulmonary edema is present, although mild dilatation of pulmonary vasculature might represent mild-to-moderate degree of congestive heart failure. . [**9-11**] CXR Compared to the prior study there has been a decrease in the left pleural effusion and improved aeration of the left lung base. The appearance of the right pleural effusion is essentially unchanged. The heart remains enlarged. Tip of the right PICC line remains in good position in the distal SVC. IMPRESSION: Decreased size of left pleural effusion. Essentially unchanged right pleural effusion. Brief Hospital Course: #LLE CELLULITIS: On admission, she had a LLE wound in the setting of significant lower extremity edema. MRSA was cultured from the wound and she was given a full 14 day course of IV vancomycin with significant improvement. . #DIARRHEA: She was c-diff negative x 3, but responded to a 14 day course of flagyl. Her diarrhea subsided during the first week of her stay. . # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: During the beginning of her hospital course, Ms. [**Known lastname 32729**] became significantly more short of breath. Because of her history of hypercapneic respiratory failure, her oxygen was titrated to an SpO2 between 85 and 92. She received albuterol nebulizer prn. In the days prior to her transfer to the MICU, she was noted to be intermittently more somnolent. Serial ABGs showed her pCO2 ranging from 50 (which was established to be her baseline for the stay) to over 60. Over the last 24 to 48 hours before transfer to the MICU, her pCO2 slowly increased to the mid 50's, but she was breathing increasingly faster. On the day of transfer, her respiratory rate reached roughly 60 breaths per minute. She was transfered for impending respiratory failure. Her respiratory status subsequently improved and she was again transferred to the floor. Overnight on [**2114-9-1**], she complained of SOB and was given extra doses of chlorthiazide and ethycrynic acid; she is allergic to lasix. Her SOB did not improve as her oxygen requirement went up. Her ABG morning of [**2114-9-1**] was 7.37, 76, 49 on 10 liters of oxygen. She was tachypneic, breathing 40 times a minute with signs of accessory muscle use and retractions. She received a combivent neb and her ABG marginally improved to 7.41, 68, 77. She moved air somewhat better and was saturating 88% on 3LNC. She was sent to the MICU for frequent desaturations, nursing concern and increased nursing care. She has poor lung function at baseline due to a number of underlying diseases: COPD, restrictive lung physiology from kyphoscoliosis, OSA, dCHF, moderate pulm HTN. She has little reserve and is chronically complaining of SOB and lives with SaO2 sat at 88%. She is a chronic Co2 retainer with PaCO2 in the 60s and bicarb between 35 and 40. Moveover, in the MICU she was not compliant with her CPAP machine for OSA and sometimes does not comply with O2 via nasal cannula. Her latest decompensation may be attributed to volume overload. Initial physical exam was remarkable for JVP to the angle of jaw and her CXR is consistent with more pulmonary edema. Diuresis with ethycrinic acid and chlorothiazide was intermittently held given elevated creatinine. She did not seem to be infected: no fever, no cough or sputum to suggest PNA. However, she had a mild leukocytosis. Goal was to keep SaO2 at 88-92 with intermittent hypercarbic mental status change, especially when patient was noncomplaint with BiPAP or O2 by nasal cannula. Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers were intermittently given as needed but occasionally caused her to be tachycardic. Patient has been off BiPAP for the past 2 days and tolerated O2 via nasal cannula; her mental status is at baseline and she has not been hypersomnolent. At rehabiliation, continue 2 L of nasal cannula; continue ipratropium inhalers every 6 hours while awake; and fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg inhalers [**Hospital1 **]. Also, to prevent volume overload, continue chlorothiazide 250 mg PO daily and restart ethacrynic acid 100 mg PO daily if needed. . # RENAL FAILURE: Upon admission, her creatinine was 1.7 which then [**Known firstname **] to over 2. She was given small fluid boluses that were limited by her inneffective cardiac output, and her renal failure was thought to be due to underperfusion. This was supported by a calculated FeNa below 1. Renal perfusion was managed by improving her heart rate control to maximize filling time and cardiac output. Her baseline creatinine is about 1.5. Renal consult was initially following her her acute on chronic renal failure is attributed to cardiogenic prerenal cause. It is difficult to balance her CHF and pulmonary decline with her renal function. We diuresed the patient gently with chlorthiazide and ethacrynic acid. At rehabiliation, continue to watch intake and output closely; continue chlorothiazide 250 mg PO daily and restart ethacrynic acid 100 mg PO daily if needed to keep patient's intake and output goal even. . #CHF/diastolic dysfunction: Ms. [**Known lastname 32729**] was significantly fluid overloaded throughout her stay. She was initially managed with ethacrynic acid 50mg qday, which was found to be inadequate. Diuril 500 followed by ethacrynic acid 100mg [**Hospital1 **] as well as prn [**Hospital1 **] was initiated with better success. Diuresis was limited by prerenal renal failure. . # AFIB: Initial rate control was with diltiazem, which was increased to 90 qid, and limited by hypotension. Diltiazem was titrated down and she was loaded with digoxin with better control of her rate. Her blood pressure was improved with rate control. Her INR was supratherapeutic upon admission, which normalized slowly with vitamin K, and was maintained at therapeutic levels with 1mg coumadin qday until the day of transfer at which time she was noted to be subtherapeutic. She is rate controlled and anticoagulated. Continue Diltiazem 30mg PO four times a day and Amidarone 100mg daily at rehabilitation. . # HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continue outpatient synthroid while an inpatient. . # ANEMIA: Admitted with HCT of 34, slowly trending down with component of anemia of chronic disease and also some component of phlebotomy after prolonged hospital stay. No localizing source of bleed stable upon stay in MICU. . # FEN: Poor PO intake since admission. Since MICU transfer on [**2114-9-1**], she was NPO given tenuous respiratory status and risk of aspiration. Dobhoff and tube feeds were not possible considering intermittent BiPAP. On [**9-9**] off BiPAP, her diet was advanced diet to pureed liquids and chocolate Ensure after discussion regarding the risk of aspiration with her daughter, health care proxy, versus the risk of continued malnutrition. Her daughter agreed to advance feeding to pureed foods. Please continue chocolate Ensure and pureed diet in rehabilitation. . # PPX: On PPI. Warfarin for atrial fibrillation restarted upon discharge. . # ACCESS: PIV and single lumen PICC. . # CODE STATUS AND COMMUNICATION: s/p palliative care and ethics consult.

Past Oncologic History per oncology notes: SCLC- routine MRCP performed in follow up of her IPMT on [**2155-3-19**], which showed a possible right posterior rib lesion. She had a chest CT performed on [**2155-4-23**], which showed a 2.7 x 1.7 cm soft tissue density that extended to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe. This corresponded to the abnormality seen on the MRCP. In addition, there were lymph nodes noted in the prevascular, peritracheal, subcarinal, and mediastinal stationed in the right hilum. FDG/PET imaging showed intensely FDG avid dominant right lung nodule and intensely FDG avid right hilar, right peritracheal, and precarinal lymph nodes. She underwent mediastinoscopy and lymph node biopsy showed small cell lung cancer.

Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care.. . #Pneumonia with respiratory failure/hypoxemia/pulmonary infiltrates: s/p severe sepsis. Hypoxemia and infiltrates thought to be multifactoral from PNA, flare of eosinophilic pneumonia, acute diastolic CHF, and possibly ?ARDS. Pt with limited pulmonary reserve and underlying restrictive lung disease. Unclear etiology of infection as BAL did not reveal an organism (however this was performed on antibiotic therapy. BAL negative for Pneumocystis. Serum b-glucan negative, galactomannan negative. Pt was given vanco, zosyn, levofloxacin in ICU and completed 10 days of therapy on [**10-5**]. However, she experienced worsening hypoxia, tachypnea and a LLL infilrate on [**10-7**] and antibiotics (vanco/cefepime/flagyl) were started and plan for a 14 day course (to end on [**10-20**]). In terms of vanco, pt was given 1gm [**Hospital1 **]. However, trough on [**10-11**] was found to be supratherapeutic at 53 and vanco was held on [**10-12**]. PLEASE CHECK A VANCO TROUGH [**10-13**] AM AND DOSE VANCOMYCIN ACCORDINGLY. RECOMMEND STARTING AT 750MG [**Hospital1 **]. Pt was given stress dose steroids in the ICU and her prednisone was initially weaned to 30mg daily for eosinophilic PNA. Given continued hypoxia and wheezing, prednisone was increased to 60mg daily on [**10-9**]. Will plan for 60mg x1 week, then to decrease by 10mg weekly (starting on [**10-16**] at 50mg daily etc) until she achieves her home dose of 15mg daily.. PT was continued on nebulizer therapy. She was given IV lasix for diuresis with goal -1L daily until [**10-10**] when pt appeared to be dry and as she did not take good PO. Would resume home lasix 40mg daily on [**10-13**] and consider DC of this medication if pt does not take good PO. Repeat chest CT on [**10-8**] shows continuation of PNA and was essentially unchanged compared to prior. Pt will certainly need pulmonary rehab and close pulmonary follow up after discharge. Pt remained consistently on 4L O2 during admission. On day of discharge pt was 98% on 3L and in general on mid 90's on 3L. Pt is likely to have a slow recovery course given her baseline poor lung function. She should be sure to follow with her [**Month/Year (2) 3390**] and pulmonologist after discharge from rehab. . #s/p acute renal failure-Hypotensive and pressor dependent at OSH prior to transfer. Renal function improved with resuscitation. Cr on discharge was 1.0. . #acute diastolic heart failure/anasarca-after volume resuscitation and ICU course. Last echo with normal EF. Pt was given lasix 40mg IV prn to achieve goal of -1L daily until [**10-11**] when she appeared dry and was not taking good PO. Would consider restarting home dose of 40mg PO daily on [**10-13**]. Would DC if pt does not take in good PO. Repeat chest CT as above showed continued pneumonia. . #eosinophilic pneumonia-on 3L home o2. Steroids, 15mg daily home dose. Pt was given stress dose steroids in ICU. Transferred out of ICU on 30mg daily. However, given worsening respiratory status and likely additional reactive airways component, increased to 60mg daily, taper to be started after discharge. 60mg x1 week, then taper by 10mg weekly starting [**10-16**], down to home dose of 15mg daily. Pt was continued on oxygen, steroids. She should resume advair upon discharge. She will need outpt follow up with her pulmonologist. She has a sulfa allergy and therefore bactrim could not be used for [**Month/Day (4) 3390**] [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. Pt was started on atovoquone 1500mg daily upon discharge. She should also take calcium and vitamin D as well as PPI for prophylaxis. . #metabolic encephalopathy-likely due to ICU course and infection. Per husband has been having periods of fluctuations in mental status since extubation. Husband reports that patient was doing her check book and playing on the computer prior to ICU admission. In addition, he does report that she was having difficulty with swallowing solids and pills prior to admission. Face symmetric and moved all extremities. Head CT performed and showed parenchymal atrophy and sequela of small vessel microvascular infarction with no acute intracranial findings. Venous ABG did not show signficant hypercarbia. MRI was performed as pt remained persistently encephalopathic despite treatment for medical conditions. MRI did not show infarct but did show "unchanged periventricular t2 and flair hyperintensities in bilateral cerebral hemispheres and pons, which likely represent treatment-related changes are prior whole brain radiation. Pt remained mostly encephalopathic while on the medical floor (awake, alert, but not following commands reliably, liked to stare at the TV), despite treatment for the above infection and frequent reorientation. Pt has been stabily in this state since [**2159-10-6**] when her care was assumed on the medical floor. She is able to squeeze b/l upper extremities, wiggle her toes, but has inattention when attempting cranial nerve exam. She tends to answer with yes/no answers and it does require alot of prompting to get an answer. She is awake and looking at you when you ask questions but is very slow to respond. EKG and cardiac enzymes did not show ischemia. TSH, B12 and folate were normal. Pt was not given any sedating medications (such as opiates, benzos, benedryl) on the medical floor. There was never any overt evidence of seizure activity. She was able to formulate sentences on rare occasion. Pt has been reliably in this state since [**2159-10-6**]. This may be patient's new baseline if she had suffered an anoxic event during her course or it is likely that pt has hypoactive delerium. Frequent reorientation will be key. Pt is on tramadol and neurontin as an outpatient and these medications were not given during admission. . #ICU Deconditioning/Steroid myopathy: PT consulted as well as speech and swallow. Speech and swallow stated regular diet could be given as long as pt awake, however they recommended purees and thins until pt's mental status improves. Pt will go to rehab after discharge. Steroid taper to continue after discharge. . #Leukocytosis: Likely due to steroids, pneumonia. UCX did not show infection. Blood cultures negative. C.diff x3 negative. Antibiotics were continued as above . #IPMT/pancreatic cyst-outpatient f/u. s/p prior ERCP showing pancreatic divisum. Will need outpt GI follow up (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge from rehab. . #normocytic Anemia: HCT has been stable. Likely multifactoral an recently related to acute/chronic inflammation. NO signs of active bleeding. Pt was continued on home iron therapy. HCT on discharge 28.2 Should consider colonoscopy if not already performed in outpatient setting. . #thyroid nodule-"16-mm left thyroid nodule is unchanged since [**2158**] and can be further evaluated with ultrasound if not previously performed".

Over the past 2 weeks, she has had progressively worsening DOE and intermittent chest tightness. She repots that this has progressively gotten worse since she began to take the new medications since d/c from hospital (see below). She can only walk ~ 5ft w/o DOE and does not recall how far she could walk prior to this exacerbation. She has no CP or SOB at rest. There have been URI sx, she has had nonproductive cough. She denies dietary indiscretions. Did not notice weight gain. . She had a recent hospitalization ([**10-11**] - [**10-13**]) at which time cardiac cath showed proximal LAD had 40% in-stent restenosis with patent proximal RCA stent though there were serial 60% to 80% stenosis throughout the mid to distal LAD, the circumflex had proximal 40% stenosis, and the distal left circumflex was occluded with collateralization. There were also 40% stenoses in the mid and distal RCA. She was deemed to have two-vessel coronary artery disease that was not intervenable by angiography and would not be a good CABG candidate. Her blood pressure was very high during her hospitalization and peri-procedure, thus it was felt that the most useful thing to do would be to aggressively control her blood pressure and improve the flow to her transplanted kidney. . During this hospitalization, her lisinopril was increased to 30 mg and Imdur was added though not continued as an outpatient her PCP notes in [**Name9 (PRE) **]. . Per OMR, PCP was called by VNA on [**10-21**] for hypertension (180/80); at this point, she had started the increased lisinopril and imdur and was started on Norvasc 2.5mg QD (which she did not take). . On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, but endorses hx of DVT (timing unclear and unsure if its venous or arterial), no pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She reports leg pain w/ ambulation. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on exertion. She denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. . In the ED, initial vitals were 98.1F, 191/90, 68, 92% on RA. She c/o of CP, had rales b/l. She was given SL nitro, lasix 60mg IV, started on NTG gtt, given ASA 325mg and was placed on BiPAP 10/5. She also received CaGluconate, 10U of insulin and D50 amp for K of 6.8. . In the ICU, vitals were 98F, 175/53, 97, 20 100% 50%O2 on Bipap [**3-30**]. pt. was resting comfortably.

EKG [**2201-10-26**]: NSR, No peaked Tw or Twi. Anteroseptal ST elev < 1mm, unchanged from prior [**2201-10-13**] . CXR [**2201-10-26**]: These findings favor cardiogenic edema with slightly more confluent collection in the right mid lung zone. Conversely this particular area may represent a focus of infection and repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended. . CXR [**2201-10-27**]: Resolution of cardiogenic edema. Stable-appearing right upper lobe nodule, consistent with old granulomatous disease . Renal U/S [**2201-10-28**]: No significant abnormality or change in appearance of the transplanted kidney which has patent vasculature. Brief Hospital Course: 1. DYSPNEA The patient was admitted with signs and symptoms of left sided heart failure, likely from poor hypertension control and flash pulmonary edema. Her chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema. She initially required bipap but was given 40mg IV Lasix in the ED and 40mg IV Lasix on admission and responded. She was placed on a nitroglycerin drip on admission and this was able to be titrated down and stopped on [**2201-10-27**]. Her oxygen was able to be weaned to minimal settings after diuresis. She was then put on her home dose of Lasix 20mg PO qday. She was ordered for Amlodipine 5mg PO qday but refused to take this due to a history of leg swelling as a side effect. Her Lisinopril was restarted but stopped on [**2201-10-27**] due to rising creatinine. On discharge, she was able to maintain sats on room air and hypertension was well controled on Carvedilol, Lasix 20mg PO qday and Imdur 30mg PO qday. Her blood pressure returned to the 100s-120s systolic prior to transfer with minimal adjustments to her home medications and discontinuing her Lisinopril. On discharge, her Lasix was discontinued and Imdur was increased to 60mg PO qday for blood pressure control. . 2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE The patient presented with signs and symptoms of unstable angina with chest pain. ECG was unchaged from prior. She has known 3 vessel disease and is not a good candidate for CABG or stenting. Medical management was optimized and she was kept on Aspirin, Carvedilol and Imdur. Cardiac enzymes were flat. She was initially put on Lisinopril but this was stopped as her creatinine rose. . 3. CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE The patient has chronic renal failure with an allograft renal transplant. Her creatinine was elevated to 2.1 on admission from a baseline of 1.9. The renal trasplant service was consulted. She had a renal ultrasound which showed patent vasculature. She was continued on Cellcept, Tacrolimus and Prednisone for her transplant. Her creatinine increased to 2.7 by the time of discharge. She has follow-up with her transplant nephrologist after discharge. . 4. ANEMIA The patient's hematocrit was 29 on admission and trended down to 26. This was likely from anemia of chronic disease as well as renal failure and decreased erythropoetin. Iron studies were checked and the patient was not iron deficient. Retic count was 2.4. She had no signs of active bleeding and HCT was stable during the admission. She should follow-up as an outpatient for her anemia. . 5. HYPERLIPIDEMIA She was continued on Atorvastatin 40mg PO qday. . The patient was managed in the CCU initially and transferred to the floor on [**2201-10-27**]. She was discharged home on [**2201-10-30**] with instructions to follow-up with her transplant nephrologist, her cardiologist and her primary care doctor.

Discharge Date: Service: CCU HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 60 year old female with a history of hypertension, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, breast cancer and depression who slipped in the bathroom on [**2164-8-4**] and broke her left hip. Patient initially was evaluated and admitted by orthopaedics for open However, patient had an episode of worsening shortness of breath and hypoxia secondary to CHF prior to surgery. Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] medicine team on [**2164-8-6**], and had continued worsening of her respiratory status with desaturations into the mid-80s in the context of aggressive diuresis with Lasix. Cardiology was consulted on [**2164-8-7**], and they advised a blood transfusion and verapamil to minimize the patient's outflow tract gradient associated with her hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Patient was started on Lopressor and given 2 units of packed red blood cells and gentle intravenous fluids at which time she was transferred to the coronary critical care unit on [**2164-8-8**], for management of her congestive heart failure associated with HOCM. Additionally her hospital course prior to transfer to the CCU team was complicated by a temperature spike on [**2164-8-7**], from an unknown source. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) which was diagnosed by an echo in [**2162**] showing an ejection fraction of 65% and a dynamic outflow tract gradient. Hypertension. Schizoaffective personality disorder along with major depression and anxiety disorder. MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION: Included Celexa 20 mg q.day, Paxil 20 mg q.day, Ativan 1 mg t.i.d., Zyprexa 5 mg b.i.d., verapamil 240 mg b.i.d., albuterol, Atrovent, Premarin. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Generally she was an anxious, but alert and oriented times three, obese female. HEENT: extraocular movements were intact. Mucous membranes were dry. Oropharynx was clear. Neck exam no JVP, no thyromegaly, no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular exam regular rate, normal S1, no S2 appreciated with a 3/6 systolic diamond-shaped murmur radiating to the axilla and abdomen. Additionally, there was a [**3-28**] diastolic decrescendo murmur appreciated at the apex. No rubs appreciated. Lung exam clear to auscultation in the upper lung fields with bibasilar crackles. Abdominal exam distended, tender to deep palpation diffusely with active bowel sounds, no rebound, no guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: patient had 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses in the right lower extremity, but 1+ pulses in the left lower extremity, 2+ capillary refill bilaterally. No edema, no palpable cords, negative Homans sign, positive pain to deep palpation of the left hip with decreased range of motion of the left hip. LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 9.7, hemoglobin 10.7, hematocrit 31.5, platelets 179, retic count 1.8. UA showed large amount of blood, negative nitrites, 100 mg/dl protein, negative glucose, negative ketones, small amount of bilirubin, 0.2 urobili, pH 5, negative leukocyte esterase, specific gravity 1.025. Microscopic exam of the urine showed greater than 50 red blood cells, 6 to 10 white blood cells, no bacteria, no yeast, 3 to 5 squamous epithelial cells. Chem-7 sodium 142, potassium 3.5, chloride 103, bicarb 29, BUN 16, creatinine 1.4, no glucose done. CK was 378, MB 3, troponin 2.4. Calcium was 8.9, phosphate 2.8, magnesium 1.9. Patient had an echocardiogram done on [**2164-8-7**], that showed an elongated left atrium with moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular systolic function was hyperdynamic with an ejection fraction greater than 75% with a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Findings were consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal. Ascending aorta was mildly dilated. Aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened. Mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened. There was no mitral valve prolapse, mild 1+ mitral regurg, no pericardial effusion. Compared with the previous study on [**2162-10-29**], left ventricle is now frankly hyperdynamic and the intracavitary gradient is much higher. Left ventricular cavity and stroke volume are smaller. Cardiac output is probably low. CT scan of the pelvis and hip with 2 mm cuts was done on the day of admission, [**2164-8-4**]. It showed severely comminuted left acetabular fracture with axial migration of the femoral head into the pelvis, left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, likely old pubic symphysis injury and no significant pelvic hematoma. Chest x-ray on [**2164-8-4**] showed stable cardiomegaly, mediastinal and hilar contours were stable in appearance compared with previous exam on [**2164-6-18**]. Lungs demonstrated no focal consolidation, pneumothoraces or pleural effusion. There was persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Soft tissues and osseous structures were unremarkable. Chest x-ray on [**2164-8-6**], showed interval development of congestive heart failure with interstitial edema and a new left retrocardiac opacity mostly due to atelectasis or aspiration in this recently postoperative patient which is actually not true. An early focus of pneumonia would be considered less likely, but could not be excluded. EKG on [**8-5**] on admission showed sinus rhythm, LVH with secondary ST-T changes and no significant changes compared with previous tracing. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular system. Coronary artery disease: patient has no known coronary artery disease. Pump: strategy of treatment throughout the patient's CCU stay was aggressive negative inotropic administration with optimization of patient's intervascular volume. Initially prior to [**Hospital 228**] transfer to CCU, patient was -diuresed and in setting of outflow tract obstruction and increaed castecholamine state developed worsening congestive heart failure. Initial strategy included beta blockade with IV esmolol, pain control and gentle hydration. She later experienced decreased urine output ultimately determined secondary to transient acute renal failure. Pulmonary artery catheter was placed on [**2164-8-8**], which showed significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressures averaging in the 70s systolic and 30s diastolic with central venous pressures in the 30s and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures in the 30s. She was managed with target PAD of 20-25 and CVP of [**9-1**] mmHg. After the patient was brought back from the O.R. on [**2164-8-9**], esmolol drip was continued, but weaned to off on [**2164-8-14**], while p.o. Lopressor was titrated up to a maximum dose of 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. Additionally, verapamil was added on [**2164-8-17**]. Echocardiogram was repeated on [**2164-8-14**], that showed an ejection fraction of greater than 70% along with left atrium elongation with moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal cavity size with excellent systolic function. However, there was a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with a difficult to assess magnitude due to anteriorly directed mitral regurgitation. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were normal. Aortic valve leaflets were structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There was no aortic regurg seen. Mitral valve leaflets were structurally normal. There was systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets and anterior directed jet of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation was seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There was a trivial physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study on [**2164-8-7**], the severity of mitral regurgitation had increased, but may be related to the dynamic gradient/valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] which was also present on the prior study. Patient also required benalefarin drip administration for several days after surgery to maintain her blood pressure. However, this was able to be weaned as patient's sedation was able to be weaned and was completely removed on [**2164-8-14**]. Rhythm: patient had no arrhythmias during her hospital course. She was on telemetry throughout her hospital course. Her EKGs showed no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia despite her slight CK and troponin leak noted during her transfer to the CCU. It was thought that these enzymatic abnormalities were a result of strain in the context of her hyperdynamic state. 2. Pulmonary. Patient was intubated electively prior to surgery and remained intubated on [**2164-8-18**]. Patient was noted to have pulmonary edema with possible left sided infiltrate postoperatively. The infiltrate was thought to be either atelectasis or pneumonia. Patient was thought to be at high risk for pulmonary embolism due to her left hip fracture and inability to increase her activity level in her sedated state. Patient was given prophylactic subcutaneous Lovenox both preoperatively and postoperatively for DVT prophylaxis. Patient's largely elevated pulmonary artery pressures were thought to be a result of her chronic outflow tract gradient and likely chronic congestive lung picture. Additionally, patient was fluid overloaded, however, pulmonary embolism could not be completely ruled out with such high pulmonary artery pressures. Whether or not those pulmonary artery pressures are out of proportion to her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure could not be determined. Orthopaedic surgery was consulted regarding empiric full anticoagulation for potential pulmonary embolism, however, they recommended that full anticoagulation not be pursued since it would almost definitely lead to significant bleeding into her postoperative hip. Therefore, CT angio was not pursued as full anticoagulation could not be undertaken. Patient was weaned off assist control ventilation to pressure support on [**2164-8-15**], and was able to maintain several hours on pressure support without hypoxia or signs of respiratory distress. However, patient occasionally became agitated with the pressure support and was placed back on assist control and vacillated between assist control and pressure support throughout her time of intubation. 3. Renal. Patient's urine output had dropped to roughly 5 cc an hour prior to surgery as a result of a brief period of hypotension prior to transfer to the CCU. Patient did not initially respond to fluid challenges. Urine was spun down by the CCU team and analysis of the pellet revealed muddy brown casts and sloughed tubular cells which were consistent with acute tubular necrosis. However, due to the emergent nature of her left hip, she was taken to surgery despite her low urine output. Additionally, her creatinine elevated from baseline of 1.0 to as high as 1.8. When patient returned from surgery after getting several liters of fluid, she began to increase her urine output and her creatinine diminished to her baseline levels by post-op day two. Throughout the remainder of the hospitalization patient's urine output was perdigious and her BUN and creatinine remained stable at her baseline levels. 4. Musculoskeletal. Patient had her hip fracture repaired via open reduction and internal fixation on [**2164-8-9**]. It was a technically difficult surgery with multiple approaches needed to facilitate the repair. Patient lost 3.5 liters of blood and was transfused 11 units of blood, 7 units of FFP and 2 units of plasma during the procedure. Patient continued to be followed by orthopaedics throughout her hospitalization. Patient's wound showed no evidence of infection and the two JP drains were removed as their drainage became minimal. Orthopaedics recommended two weeks of empiric antibiotic treatment with Levaquin and Kefzol. They also recommended against full anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism and recommended a prophylactic dose of subcutaneous Lovenox to be given until patient's activity level was able to be increased. 5. Infectious disease. Patient initially spiked a fever two days prior to surgery and remained febrile both before surgery and after surgery with a high grade fever that never dropped below 101 and went as high as 103.6 until [**2164-8-16**]. Initially patient was given one dose of renally dosed Levaquin prior to surgery and then continued on Levaquin and started on Kefzol after surgery on [**8-9**]. This regimen was switched to Ceftaz and vanc on [**2164-8-12**], due to gram negative rods that were noted on the gram stain of the patient's sputum and in the context of continued high grade fever. Flagyl was added on [**2164-8-13**], for anaerobic coverage. Echo on [**8-14**] was negative for endocarditis. Patient was also noted on [**8-13**] to have vaginal discharge consistent with yeast infection. She was started on vaginal nystatin suppositories on that same day. Patient was also given one shot of IV fluconazole on [**8-16**] as a definitive treatment for this presumed yeast infection. Patient remained febrile, as noted above, to temperatures as high as 103.5 until [**8-16**] and this was despite maximal Tylenol dosing and additional ibuprofen dosing. It was thought that drug fever might be a possibility for this patient's fever, however, her antibiotics had been switched multiple times with no effect on her fever curve. It was thought on [**8-16**] that patient's aggressive antipsychotic, antidepressant medical regimen could be the cause of her hyperpyrexia as neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potential side effect of Zyprexa. These meds were all discontinued, which included Zyprexa, Paxil and Celexa, on [**2164-8-15**], and patient, for the first time since [**2164-8-7**], defervesced 24 hours after these medications were discontinued. Infectious disease was consulted on [**2164-8-15**], at the same time that the psych meds were discontinued. They recommended abdominal and pelvic CT exam as well as left hip ultrasound for identification of potential abscess formation. All these studies were negative as were three sets of blood cultures, two sets of urine cultures and three sets of sputum cultures. As a result of negative blood tests and negative studies, patient was discontinued off all antibiotics on [**2164-8-16**], per ID recommendations, which took into consideration the patient's break in her fever on that same day. Patient was noted to have positive C.diff assay on [**2164-8-16**], and patient again spiked a fever on [**2164-8-17**], to 101.3 after being afebrile for 24 hours. This was thought to be the result of the patient's C.diff infection and only p.o. Flagyl was started for coverage of C.diff. Additionally, on [**2164-8-17**], patient's Swan-Ganz catheter was pulled. Right IJ was changed over a wire and right ART line was switched to left ART line per ID request. 5. FEN/GI. Patient had four days of post-op ileus after surgery and was not able to tolerate tube feeds. TPN was considered, but not started as patient's post-op ileus resolved on [**8-12**] after Reglan was started. Patient developed C.diff colitis on [**2164-8-16**]. Patient's bowel regimen was discontinued and patient was able to tolerate some tube feeds. Additionally, patient's sedation was weaned significantly on [**2164-8-14**]. Versed was weaned off and fentanyl was weaned to 25 mcg per hour which significantly improved patient's bowel activity. 6. Neuro. Patient was thought to have a relatively functional baseline mental capacity. However, patient remained relatively highly sedated several days post-op due to her multiple medications and prolonged psych drug regimen. Psych drugs were discontinued on the 24th and sedation was weaned down on the 23rd, which led to significantly improved mental status. However, patient's status had not improved enough on the 26th to justify extubation as it was thought patient would not be able to tolerate due to her lethargic, sedated state. Head CT was considered, however, this was not pursued due to patient's significant improvement on [**8-15**]. However, this would be a reasonable study if patient's mental status did not improve. Additionally, neurology could be consulted if patient's mental status does not improve. However, patient has at no time been completely weaned off all sedative medications because without these medications, she would not be able to tolerate her ventilation, which was thought to be necessary for her congestive heart failure up until [**2164-8-17**]. 7. Prophylaxis. Patient was given Protonix for peptic ulcer disease and pneumo-boots along with subcu Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. Patient had bilateral peripheral IVs for access and right IJ for access and left ART line that was resided on [**2164-8-17**]. Patient is a full code. Additionally, an addendum will be added to this discharge summary prior to the patient's actual discharge.

Service: [**Doctor Last Name **]-MEDIC HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient was transferred from the Cardiac Care Unit on [**2164-7-25**]. For a description of the events taken place in the Cardiac Care Unit, please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 101113**] discharge note for the Cardiac Care Unit. Briefly, the patient is a 68 year old female with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy diagnosed by echocardiogram in the year [**2162**], who broke her left hip on [**2164-8-4**], and was admitted to the Orthopedic Service for open reduction and internal fixation. However, prior to sickle cell, the patient experienced shortness of breath secondary to congestive heart failure and was transferred to the [**Hospital6 22258**] where she was aggressively diuresed with Lasix. She experienced worsening respiratory distress. Cardiology advised a blood transfusion and aggressive administration of negative inotropics (Lopressor 100 four times a day and Verapamil 80 three times a day currently), and close monitoring of intervascular volume (goal euvolemic) in order to minimize the patient's outflow tract gradient. She was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit on [**8-8**], where she was intubated for respiratory decompensation and underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the left hip on [**8-9**], which required 11 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 2 units of plasma. During her stay in the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient's main issues have included the following: 1) Aggressive use of negative inotropics and close maintenance of euvolemic to minimize outflow tract gradient; 2) prolonged ventilation with extubation [**8-22**]; 3) brief oliguria secondary to ATN following surgery, now resolved; 4) prolonged high-grade fevers to 103.0 F./104.0 F., thought to be secondary to Zyprexa induced NMS, then C. difficile infection; 5) persistent obtunded state secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy diagnosed by echocardiogram in [**2162**]. 2. Hypertension. 3. Schizo-affective personality disorder. 4. Depression. 5. Anxiety disorder. 6. Breast cancer. MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO TRANSFER: 1. Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneously twice a day. 2. Protonix 40 mg intravenously q. day. 3. Calcium carbonate 1000 mg four times a day. 4. Miconazole. 5. Nystatin swish and swallow. 6. Metoprolol 100 p.o. four times a day. 7. Verapamil 80 mg p.o. three times a day. 8. Fentanyl patch 25 micrograms. 9. Tylenol 500 to 1000 mg p.r.n. 10. Bumetanide 1 gram intravenously q. day. 11. Risperidone 1 mg p.o. p.r.n. 12. Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon arrival, the patient was afebrile with a temperature of 97.2 F.; pulse of 88; blood pressure of 128/72; tachypneic at a rate of 36, saturation of 98% by 40% face mask. In general, this is an obtunded female laying in bed, with very shallow rapid breathing. Her pupils were equal, round and reactive to light. Her eyes were anicteric. Oropharynx is benign. Anterior lung fields were clear bilaterally. Her heart was regular rate and rhythm. III/VI harsh systolic murmur best heard at the apex. Her abdomen was soft, obese, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds with no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities were cool and dry with one plus distal pulses bilaterally; no edema. Foley catheter and rectal bag were in place. Left inguinal incision was clean, dry and intact. She intermittently answered the questions, acknowledged the presence of visitors. She would track movements in the room but otherwise was very unresponsive. LABORATORY: She had a white blood cell count of 8.6, hematocrit of 28.4, platelet count of 439. Coags were a PT of 13.5, PTT of 25.6 and an INR of 1.3. Chem-10 included the sodium of 142, potassium 3.5, chloride 103, bicarbonate 31, BUN of 21, creatinine 0.6, glucose of 127. Calcium 9.1, phosphorus 3.3, magnesium 2.2. STUDIES: Echocardiogram on [**8-14**] showed elongated left atrium, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, severe resting left ventricular outflow tract, normal right ventricular size and wall motion, three plus mitral regurgitation (increased compared to [**8-6**] study), ejection fraction of 70%. She was Clostridium difficile positive on [**8-16**]. Chest x-ray on [**8-21**] which showed a new left lower lobe consolidation consistent with either pneumonia or atelectasis. LENI's performed on [**8-20**] were negative for deep venous thrombosis. CT scan of the abdomen / pelvis on [**8-16**], which showed post-traumatic changes around the left pelvic fracture. There were no signs of abscess. Overall appearance is of stranding and fluid amongst the left hip muscles, consistent with resolving hematoma. Right lower lobe pneumonia versus contusion bilaterally with small pleural effusion. Renal scarring. SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiac: The patient continued to be managed aggressively with high dose Lopressor and Verapamil. There was careful attention paid to strict maintenance of intakes an outputs. She continued to receive her Bumex 1 gram every morning. The overall strategy for her cardiac status was, as noted in the Cardiac Care Unit note, to administer aggressive negative inotropics with optimization of patient's intervascular volume. Again, the patient has no history of coronary artery disease. She did not have any episodes of arrhythmia during her hospital course. She did, however, continue to have a low baseline troponin leak. Her troponin was always greater than 1.6 every time it was measured. It was never higher than 3.5. It was believed that this mild troponin leak was secondary to constant strain given the patient's hyperdynamic state. 2. Pulmonary: The patient was initially transferred to the Floor on 50% face mask. She was weaned to room air successfully on [**8-28**]. She had required Bi-PAP in the Cardiac Care Unit, but it was never required on the floor. She did, however, have one episode of tachypnea early on in her course on the floor on [**8-25**], with respiratory rates in the mid-40s. She continued to have O2 saturations in the high 90s during this time with normal blood pressure and slightly tachycardic. This episode self resolved. She had subtle EKG changes, specifically ST abnormalities which were present on her EKG before. During this setting of tachypnea, her troponin rose from her baseline one to two range to a maximum of 3.5. Chest x-ray taken at this time showed persistent mild congestive heart failure. 3. Neurologic: Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was initially weaned off her Ativan and her Fentanyl patch was discontinued. Initially, the patient's neurologic status consisted of a very sparse verbal output, not really following basic commands, very limited attention span, and persistent cogwheel rigidity. It was believed on the part of Neurology and Psychiatry consultations, that her obtundation was secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy. She had an EEG performed that showed global slowing. A head CT scan did not show any focality. Over the course in the floor, she did however, continue to improve in her neurological status to the point where she was able to recognize individuals walking into her room. Her verbal output increased. She was able to answer in full sentences. She had a longer attention span. She was able to move her upper and lower extremities more spontaneously. Over the last couple of days, she has been complaining of some depression. Her psychiatric medications were stopped while she was in the Cardiac Care Unit. Those medications should be restarted at her rehabilitation center once her neurologic status stabilized. 4. Gastrointestinal: The patient was initially continued on tube feeds by nasogastric tube upon transfer to the floor. She was transitioned to p.o. feeds on [**8-30**] after passing a bedside speech and swallow evaluation. Her present diet consists of clear liquids and pureed foods with Boost for supplementation. She should be continued on this diet, advanced slowly, and observed for any signs of aspiration. She is also receiving Colace and Sennas laxatives. 5. Renal: The patient had no acute renal issues while on the Floor. She had good urine output with stable BUN and creatinine levels. She did, however, have a continuation of a metabolic alkalosis and respiratory alkalosis after immediate transfer from the Cardiac Care Unit but these acid based disorders resolved over the course of her stay on the floor. 6. Hematologic: The patient's hematocrit was stable around 30. Her goal hematocrit was 30 and above to avoid exacerbation of her cardiac hyperdynamic state. 7. Infectious Disease: The patient experienced high grade fevers to 103.0 F., 104.0 F., in the Cardiac Care Unit and she spiked once to a temperature of 101.0 F., while on the floor. She was pan-cultured and the cultures were all negative. She completed a 10 day course of Flagyl for her C. difficile infection. She also completed a four day course of Vancomycin for a slightly purulent left inguinal wound. The wound was also debrided and is appearing clean, dry and intact currently. 8. Musculoskeletal: The patient is status post open reduction and internal fixation. She has been receiving Physical Therapy approximately three times a week for range of motion exercises, sitting in chair and increasing her weight bearing status. Her Physical Therapy should be continued with the Rehabilitation Center. She is also receiving Lovenox subcutaneously twice a day and her anti-coagulation should be continued for another two and a half weeks for a total of six weeks. 9. Prophylaxis: The patient was given Protonix for peptic ulcer disease and Pneumoboots with subcutaneous Lovenox for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient is being discharged to [**Hospital3 7**] for rehabilitation on [**2164-9-3**]. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Her diet currently is clear liquids with pureed foots and Boost for supplementation. 2. She should continue to receive Physical Therapy for rehabilitation of her left hip. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneously q. 12 times six weeks total (started on [**8-10**]). 2. Pantoprazole 40 mg intravenously q. 24 hours. 3. Calcium carbonate 1000 mg p.o. four times a day. 4. Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. q. six hours. 5. Verapamil 80 mg p.o. q. eight hours. 6. Bumetanide 1 mg intravenously q. day. 7. Albuterol nebulizer solution, one nebulizer inhaler q. two hours p.r.n. 8.

Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: Fevers Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tunnelled Catheter Placement History of Present Illness: 67m with htn, cad, afib, cva, esrd on hd presents with fevers and sepsis. He apparently was found to be febrile at HD so was transferred to the the ED. In ED, attempts at subclavian and IJ's failed and a femoral line was placed. A CT abdomen/pelvis was attempted, but contrast extravasated out into the abdominal wall, for which surgery was consulted. At the time of admission, the patient was able to anwer basic questions and follow commands, but seemed confused and was not cooperative with the interpreter.

CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to most recent prior chest film [**2168-7-11**]: Consolidation in the lung bases has improved and small left pleural effusion has decreased. Small region of prior right apical consolidation has cleared. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has decreased. There is no pneumothorax. No change in alignment of sternal wires including fracture of the most superior and the off-line configuration to the most inferior two. . CT Abd/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: 1. Complete extravasation of administered contrast into the patient's right lower quadrant in an extraperitoneal location. The likely explanation for this finding is that the right femoral CVL tip was positioned in the right inferior epigastric vein, which ruptured upon contrast administration. 2. Slightly limited exam due to the lack of intravenous contrast, but no definite acute intraabdominal abnormalities identified. . ECG	Study Date of [**2168-8-10**] 10:25:58 AM Shaky baseline. Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid heart action and tachycardia. Inideterminate axis. Non-specific ST segment depression in leads V4-V6, either rate-related or ischemic. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2168-7-10**] atrial fibrillation was previously present with likely continuation to the present. Low voltage in the limb leads as before. ST segment depressions were previously present. . TTE: Conclusions: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). 3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. 4. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. 5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 7. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 8. No evidence of endocarditis seen. 9. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-5-31**], tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are worse. . Tunnelled Cath Report: IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a tunneled left groin hemodialysis catheter for a left temporary triple-lumen hemodialysis catheter. Brief Hospital Course: 67m with cad, afib, esrd here with fevers and elevated WBC found to have MRSA sepsis now on Vancomycin IV. . #MRSA Baceteremia -- Pt met SIRS criteria with fever, wbc, and occasional tachycardia. There was no evidence of severe sepsis or septic shock, with pt actually hypertensive and no other end-organ disease noted during MICU stay. Possible primary sources for MRSA sepsis would be his HD line which was removed and site replaced.

Will plan to treat empirically for endocarditis with 6 wks of Vanc (through [**2168-9-23**].) - Last positive blood cx [**8-12**], afebrile, hemodynamically stable . # Chest Pain - Has had intermittant episodes of CP. Unlikely to be cardiac in origin as without ECG changes, prior cycled enzymes neg (elevated trop but his trop is elevated at baseline). GI causes are also in the differential and after giving maalox, symptoms resolved. Possible that the patient is having gastritis. Ordered PPI and maalox/benadryl/lidocaine mix. Patient is no longer symptomatic. . #Contrast extravasation -- Felt to be due to superficial placement of CVL. Currently asymptomatic. NTD per surgery. . #CAD -- No active ischemia, con't asa, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril. patient ruled out for mi. . #Afib -- Con't metoprolol - decreased dose to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] due to episode of bradycardia to 30s (asymptomatic).

Electronically signed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 171**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2186-9-8**] 16:47 STUDY: MRI and MRA brain, MRA neck. INDICATION: 78-year-old male status post aortic valve replacement with altered mental status. COMPARISON: CT head without contrast, [**2186-8-30**]. TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial GRE, and diffusion- weighted imaging was performed. Axial 2D time-of-flight imaging was performed of the neck and circle of [**Location (un) 431**]. Rotational reformatted images were prepared and reviewed. No IV contrast was administered secondary to poor intravenous access. MRI BRAIN: Study is limited by blooming artifact obscuring the right frontal and parietal lobes on gradient recalled echo and diffusion sequences secondary to probable support device overlying the patient. Punctate foci of slow diffusion are present within the right frontal lobe, left temporal lobe, and bilateral occipital lobes most consistent with tiny embolic infarctions. A more gyriform pattern of slow diffusion is present along the posterior left precentral gyrus (11:19,20). The right frontal and parietal lobes are not well evaluated given artifact. No mass, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of acute hemorrhage is identified. The orbital regions are within normal limits. A 1.9-cm mucus retention cyst is present within the left maxillary sinus. Fluid is present within the right mastoid air cells. MRA CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: There is a hypoplastic versus congenitally absent left A1 segment. Therefore, both anterior cerebral arteries are supplied by the right A1. No aneurysms or other vascular anomalies are identified. MRA NECK: Study is suboptimal since the patient was not able to recieve intravenous gadolinium contrast material. There is mild stenosis at the origin of the left ICA. The left external carotid artery is not detected. The right internal and external carotid systems are within normal limits. The vertebral arteries appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Tiny probably embolic infarctions involving the right frontal lobe, left temporal lobe and bilateral occipital lobes. Gyriform pattern of infarction involving the left prefrontal gyrus. 2. Mild stenosis of the left ICA at the origin. Left external carotid artery is not visualized suggesting occlusion although study is suboptimal given lack of contrast material. The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. DR.

[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 12563**] Approved: SUN [**2186-9-3**] 2:45 PM Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 40800**] was admitted on [**8-29**] after undergoing all pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On the day of admission he was brought directly to the operating room where he underwent an Aortic Valve Replacement. Please see operative report for surgical details. He weaned from bypass on Propafol and neosynephrine. He was transferred to the CVICU for postoperative monitoring. He weaned from pressors and required NTG for elevated blood pressure by POD 1. He remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint but sufferd a tonic-clonic seizure in the morning of [**8-30**]. This resolved without intervention and an emergent CT scan demonstrated old subacute strokes involving the Left pons. MRI obtained once pacing wires removed, showed probable embolic infarctions involving the right frontal lobe, left temporal lobe, and bilateral occipital lobes. As result patient had weakness or right hand and lower extremity. Neuro was consulted and recommended coumadin and follow up of left carotid stenosis in [**2-9**] months. Patient required several bronchoscopies for right middle lobe pneumonia while in the CVICU. On [**2186-9-7**] patient was on the floor and noted to have absent breath sounds in the right lung fields. Chest x-ray showed right lung collapse. Patient was started on Pulozyme nebulizers [**Hospital1 **], chest PT. By the end of [**9-7**], pt was moving air in the right lung fields and stated improvement in breathing. Serial chest x-rays showed continued improvement. Patient was noted to have motteling of legs worse than pre-op. An echocardiogram was obtained on [**9-8**] that showed LVEF greater than 55%, bio-prosthetic aortic valve appeared normal. His renal function had returned to his baseline on the am of [**9-11**]. INR trended down to 2.9 from the previous day at 3.1.

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY Date: [**2165-1-10**] Surgeon: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 275**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1539**], M.D. [**MD Number(1) 1540**] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 84-year old gentleman with a long history of tobacco use, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia in family history until about eight months ago when he noticed the requirement of needing more frequent sublingual nitroglycerin for increasing chest pain. At 1:00 a.m. on [**10-2**], while at rest in bed, he developed substernal chest pain radiating to his left shoulder with shortness of breath. He took four sublingual nitroglycerins with minimal relief. The pain kept him awake throughout the night. At 6:00 a.m. he took eight nitroglycerins without relief and also tried his albuterol inhaler. He called his daughter and she activated the emergency system and he was brought to [**Hospital3 **] at 9:00 a.m. At [**Hospital3 **], his electrocardiogram showed anterior ST elevations with lateral T-wall inversions and reciprocal inferior ST depressions. He was given aspirin, heparin, Aggrastat, and nitroglycerin. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 43634**]. At [**Hospital6 43635**], he underwent emergent cardiac catheterization, results to follow. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Angina. 3. Hypercholesterolemia. 4. Aortic stenosis. 5. Asthma. 6. Peptic ulcer disease, status post gastrectomy 30 years ago. 7. Colon cancer, status post colectomy with radiation therapy 4 years ago. 8. Peripheral vascular disease with history of bilateral lower extremity claudication. ALLERGIES: None known. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Albuterol, aspirin, Norvasc, isosorbide dinitrate, lovastatin and sublingual nitroglycerin. FAMILY HISTORY: He had a strong family history of coronary artery disease including myocardial infarction in one brother. SOCIAL HISTORY: He had a smoking history of 20 pack years, but he quit 30 years ago. He was somewhat active, walking about an hour a day. LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White count 12.1. Hematocrit 34.5. Platelet count 242. Sodium 141. K 4.2. Chloride 111. CO2 14. BUN 29. Creatinine 1.4 with blood sugar of 169. His CKs were in the 230 to 1244 range with MBs of 25 and 180 which indexed to 10.9 and 16.5, ruling him in for myocardial infarction. HOSPITAL COURSE: At cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital3 **], he had elevated filling pressures with an 80% posterior descending artery lesion, a left main left anterior descending 95% lesion, and diffusely diseased diagonal 1. They did place a stent in the left main proximal left anterior descending lesion and a balloon was placed and patient was transferred into the CCU. He was started on Plavix, heparin, Aggrastat, and captopril and he was referred to cardiothoracic surgery. He was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 71**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 72**] from cardiac surgery for evaluation in this acute myocardial infarction period. On his exam, his pressure was 110/52 with a heart rate of 80. His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam was negative. He had no carotid bruits. He had a systolic injection murmur. His lungs had crackles on the right side. He had a healed median infraumbilical scar and no masses. His abdomen was soft and nontender. He had an intraaortic balloon pump in place in his right groin. His distal pulses were present on Doppler. His chest x-ray showed some pulmonary edema. His blood gas that day was 7.41/98/30/20 with a base excess of -3. His white count had dropped to 9.4, with a hematocrit of 30, a K of 3.8, a BUN of 30 and creatinine of 1.5. He appeared to be still evolving his myocardial infarction. His left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 40 with pulmonary artery pressures of 58/42. His ejection fraction was 20% with an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm squared. The mean gradient of 14 at a peak of 23 as well as a calcified ascending aorta. All of these results were found on his echocardiogram which confirmed the presence of aortic stenosis and myocardial dysfunction. He continued to be stabilized in the CCU over the next couple of days for his evolving myocardial infarction. He had a CT scan of the chest which showed some midcalcification of the ascending aorta most prominently anteriorly and calcifications near the aortic valve. It also showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions with some loculation on the left and probable asbestosis. Please refer to the CT chest report. He was seen by clinical nutrition as he awaited surgery with the balloon pump in the CCU. He received a Swan-Ganz in the CCU as his medical issues were addressed. On [**10-8**] he underwent aortic valve replacement with a 20 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] bioprosthetic valve and a coronary artery bypass grafting times 4 with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, a vein graft to the posterolateral sequential to the ramus intermedius, and a vein graft to the posterior descending artery by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**]. He was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on a Levophed drip at 0.05 mics per kg per minute, a milrinone drip at 0.5 mics per kg per minute and a propofol drip at 30 mics per kg per minute. On his first postoperative day, he had decreased urine output. He received fluid and Lasix with a minimal response. His creatinine rose to 1.8, his hematocrit was 30 and a white count of 8.7. His lactate was 1.6. He remained on the balloon pump. Intubated on Levophed, insulin, milrinone, Neo-Synephrine and propofol. His intra-aortic balloon pump was removed on the afternoon of the second day. Renal was asked to see the patient who determined that he was probably in acute renal failure from several factors, being prerenal, intrarenal with the possibility of interstitial nephritis and probable acute tubular necrosis. This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**]. Their recommendations were followed. Over the course of the next several days, the patient was seen by physical therapy. He continued to have problems with urine output. On his second postoperative day, his creatinine rose to 2.3 with a rising white count of 14.9. He remained intubated and sedated with a blood pressure of 100/50 and a T-max of 99.1 on dopamine, Levophed, milrinone, Neo-Synephrine and propofol. He was also seen by a vascular surgeon because, after his balloon removal that afternoon, there was a question of whether or not he lost his pulse. He did have a slightly cool left foot with some mottling of the toes, with with the possibility of having showered small emboli to the vessels in the left foot during placement or removal of the balloon. This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of vascular surgery with the recommendation to anticoagulate him, and he remained on the heparin drip. He was followed every day by vascular. He was seen by renal. He continued to have slight improvement in his urine output. He did remain intubated but was following commands. He was on continuous positive airway pressure on postoperative day 3 remaining again on his inotropic and pressor support. He was seen again by nutrition. The patient was extubated on the 13th. The milrinone was off, the Neo-Synephrine was off. There were some casts and sediment with white blood cells in his urine. Amiodarone had been added in. He was being paced in the 88 to 118 range with the blood pressure ranging from 80/42 to 137/66. He remained extubated. His heparin was turned off. His white count was 11.0 on postoperative day 4. His acute renal failure continued to be followed by renal. He continued to be followed by vascular. He was started on PhosLo to increase his phosphate. He had some increased sputum production which was blood tinged. He remained on dopamine. Heparin was restarted. His creatinine continued to rise on postoperative day 5 to 4.1 with a white count of 8.5, K of 5.0, BUN of 67. He had been restarted on Levophed to help keep his pressure up, which was approximately 109/49 at the time of exam. He remained on heparin at vascular's recommendation. His platelet count continued to drop on the heparin, dropping to 34 on postoperative day 5. He was reintubated. He was seen by case management for a follow-up. He was started on levofloxacin. He was on amiodarone and Lopressor for his atrial flutter. He had some deterioration in the status of his left foot. He continued on his tube feeds and remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit. He continued to evolve multiple issues over the next several weeks which included a rising white count, failure to wean off the ventilator, decreasing breath sounds, requirements for Levophed and dopamine. He had a long and protracted stay in the Intensive Care Unit. On the day of dictation, he is postoperative day 91. He developed respiratory complications and renal complications. He ultimately received total parenteral nutrition for feeding. He required going back to the operating room for wound dehiscence and a sternal debridement on [**10-26**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. Please refer to the operative note. A large VAC dressing was placed over the wound. He was followed daily by the renal service and vascular service saw him daily over the course of the first month. His dopamine remained on, although it was turned down early on to renal dose only to help his urine output and keep his blood pressure stable. The plan was for him to get a peripheral bypass when he was fully stabilized and recovered. He was followed often by physical therapy, but given his decreased platelet count, he was unable to receive chest physical therapy. In the first month or so, his creatinine stayed in the 4 range. On [**10-18**], he was extubated and put on bilevel positive airway pressure and the total parenteral nutrition was started. He was reintubated later in the day on the 19th. The recommendations from renal continued to be followed as well as from vascular. Although he was intubated, he did remain alert and the plan was to do tracheostomy which was done on the 22nd percutaneously. He had multiple line placements over the course of the next several weeks, including subclavian and ultimately Quinton catheter placement. Patient was unable to receive a flap from plastic surgery after his sternal debridement due to multiple infections and processes that were going on including his difficulty with respiratory and renal. Their plan was to do a skin graft and on [**12-25**] he did ultimately receive that split-thickness skin graft from the right thigh to his chest wound. He also received a placement of jejunostomy tube and placement of a Quinton Permcath to his left chest wall for management of his renal failure and his open chest wall for coverage and infectious prevention. He was unable to receive his flap due to his multiple infectious issues. Those procedures were done on [**12-25**]. He also had gastrointestinal consult who followed him for elevated total bilirubin in late [**Month (only) **]. He was started on antibiotics also in [**Month (only) **], Levaquin for question of sepsis and development of cholestasis and jaundice. His AST rose to 84 with an ALT of 48. His total bilirubin rose to 11.0 with an indirect bilirubin of 0.9. His albumin continued to drop in late [**Month (only) **] as low as 1.6 which also was another reason why plastic was unwilling to take him for a flap. His heparin was discontinued and he remained on dopamine and Neo-Synephrine. In late [**Month (only) **] he also received a hematology consult to rule out hemolysis given his increased bilirubin. The recommendation was that it was not a hemolytic picture, but one of a more cholestatic one. While he was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit and received an infectious disease consult in late [**Month (only) **], he had been restarted on vancomycin and levofloxacin to also cover the possibility of sepsis and abdominal process. Multiple lines were re-wired and re-sited. He was also started on Zosyn. Ultimately he cultured out over the course of the next couple of months with Klebsiella from his chest wound, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum, and yeast from multiple sites including respiratory and urinary. At the present time, he has no bacteria in his blood stream, blood cultures have been negative. He ultimately had a DDD pacemaker placed by cardiology after an asystolic arrest in early [**Month (only) 1096**]. The wires are internal, but the pacer generator itself is external due to his skin graft and infection of his open chest. It was elected not to reimplant this, that this could be done as an outpatient when the patient recovered out in rehabilitation and was off all antibiotics with no infectious issues so it is externally on his chest. The patient remains ventilator dependent and is usually on a tracheal collar during the day and rested on the ventilator at night. Efforts were made over the course of several weeks prior to the skin grafting of his chest to get him to the point where he could nutritionally tolerate and, from an infectious point of view, tolerate having a surgical flap placed over his open chest and ultimately he was unable to achieve this and did receive a skin graft in [**Month (only) **].

Name: [**Known lastname 7960**], [**Known firstname 1340**] Unit No: [**Numeric Identifier 7961**] Service: This is an addendum to the discharge summary that was dictated earlier this morning. Continuing throughout his course he had multiple infectious disease issues. He developed zoster for which he received a course of acyclovir. His cultures came back as noted with Klebsiella ultimately in his chest wound, MRSA in his sputum. He had multiple sources of yeast. Currently his only yeast source is urine. Negative blood cultures at this point. Also in the course of the month that he was in the ICU he had a left chest tube placed for fluid and then a right chest tube placed ultimately for fluid. He received O.T. and P.T. consults. He developed another round of acute renal failure with ATN and casts in his urine. On [**11-28**] a DNR order was put into place. He also started treatment for gallstones with cholestasis on the medication ursodiol. He received a course of cefepime also. He continued to have multiple dressing changes after his split thickness skin grafts, which he does to this day. In early [**Month (only) 531**] he started dialysis after a PermCath was placed. His Dobbhoff tube was removed. He was able to use a Passy-Muir valve intermittently for his trach. On [**1-2**] he went back to the operating room for open jejunostomy tube dehiscence site. His J tube is now functioning. This was repaired and stay sutures are in place. This was done on [**12-3**]. On [**12-4**] he received a permanent DDD pacemaker with a lead that was externally placed on his chest wall due to his healing and infected chest wound. From the point of discharge today on [**1-10**] his most recent labs are as follows. White count 13.9, hematocrit 35.9, platelet count 81,000. Sodium 139, K 4.8, chloride 109, CO2 31, BUN 33, creatinine 2.2, blood sugar 164. Albumin 2.5. Vancomycin level was 21. To go by systems, currently he is neurologically alert and follows commands. He occasionally gets agitated. From a cardiac point of view, he is in sinus rhythm today. He does have his pacing lead with his external pacemaker DDD available to him and is being followed by the EP service and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7962**] for further outpatient treatment of this in the future. From a respiratory point of view, he is on CPAP and pressure support at 5 and 5 at 40%. He does use the Passy-Muir valve intermittently for his trach. He is on a trach collar this week during the day only and rested on the ventilator at night. Abdominally, he does have his midabdominal incision with good approximated margins and stay sutures in place. From a GI point of view, he is receiving Promote tube feeds through his jejunostomy tube. His chest incision is granulating in well. He currently receives saline washes and Adaptic dressing changes twice a day. From a GU point of view, he gets straight cathed every other day. He has a left subclavian PermCath access for his dialysis which takes place on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Hematology. He is HITT negative. He has received no transfusions in the past week or so. His hematocrit has been stable in the mid-30s. He has a PICC line in place for his antibiotics which are as follows. The PICC line was placed on [**1-8**]. His antibiotics currently are vancomycin, ceftazidime, fluconazole and caspofungin. I will give doses and administration information in his list of discharge medications.

IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED FROM AEROBIC BOTTLE. Brief Hospital Course: 71 y/o F w/ trach, found to have bloody secretions, fever and proteus bacteremia. . # Proteus Bacteremia- Blood cultures from [**8-21**] grew 2 out of 2 bottles positive for proteus, with intermediate sensitivity to quinolones. Levofloxacin had been initially started prior to return of sensitivities. This was changed to IV meropenem to complete 14 day course (Allergies to pcn, cephalosporins, sulfa). Suspected source is her urine, given her floridly positive urinalysis on admission. However initial urine culture was contaminated, so there is no positive urine cultures to support this. Sputum cultures were also taken, but also returned contaminated. She has had no evidence of shock, remaining hemodynamically stable, with good urine output, mentation, and baseline renal function. Midline placed for completion of IV antibiotics at rehab. . # Pneumonia- Left lung opacity on initial CXR. Clinically with increased secretions from trach, diffuse ronchi on lung exam. Initially covered with Vancomycin and Levofloxacin, subsequently changed to Meropenem on [**8-23**]. Sputum cultures contaminated. Repeat sputum cultures taken [**8-23**]. She remained stable from an oxygenation standpoint throughout her hospital course, maintained on trach mask at 30% FiO2 with intermittent suctioning for secretions. . # Bloody secretions- Small volume blood from trach site, likely secondary to bronchitis vs tracheal irritation/inflamed granulation tissue. Less likely endobronchial lesion. Bleeding in setting of anti-coagulation w/ INR 2.4 on admission. Coumadin held and given Vitamin K in ER. No further bleeding from trach over next 48 hours and hematocrit remained stable. Initial plan was for bronchoscopy to evaluate bleeding source, however patient refused procedure. This was also discussed with her son. Since she remained stable, with no further bleeding, and refused procedure, bronchoscopy was deferred and she was discharged back to her care facility on coumadin. . # CHF- She was continued on her b-blocker and lasix. . # Afib- Rate controlled with b-blocker; Anti-coagulated w/ coumadin. Initially on hold given her tracheal bleeding. Re-started prior to discharge given h/o recent CVA. . # DMII- Controlled on sliding scale insulin. Diabetic diet. . # Psych- Continued on klonpin, seroquel . # Chronic pain- Continued on methadone, gabapentin . # psoriasis- on chronic prednisone 10mg/day . # precautions- mrsa precautions, VRE . # FEN: ground textures for all meals; low fat-diabetic; cuff must be up when she takes fooby mouth. .

Service: NEUROLOGY Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: Fall and left sided inability to move. Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None History of Present Illness: 72 y/o male with PMHx significant for colon, prostate and stomach cancer who presents with concerns of a stroke. Patient was at in his current state of health this morning talking about an interesting job. He then went upstairs to the bathroom when 5 minutes later his wife heard him fall (~09:30). She then found him on the floor, in the fetal position. When spoken to, he was only able to moan. His wife was concerned about a stroke and contact[**Name (NI) **] EMS where he was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] at ~09:50. Here he was noted to have a right gaze preference, word finding difficulties and right gaze preference. A head CT was obtained and showed a right pareital stroke as well as 3 old subcortical strokes. CTA also showed blockage in the right distal M1 segement. Patient did meet time criteria for TPA and was given the bolus of iv TPA, however then the infusion was stopped as the circumstances that the patient had old cortical stroke came out. TPA was stopped because of the potential for intraparenchymal bleeding due to history of stroke in early [**Month (only) **]. Of note, during his last admission neurology was consulted for concerns with difficulties with complex spatial tasks and a recent fall. His exam was notable for mild inattention, difficulty with calculations, mildly unsteady tandem gain, left neglect with spatial tasks and signs of apraxia. MRI showed bilateral parietal gyriform enhancing lesions of unclear etiology with etiologies ranging from subacute stroke to leptomeningeal metastasis to cerebritis. An LP to rule out infection (WBC 1, RBC 90 with 0 polys, 57 lymphs and 43 monos, protein 67 and glucose 60) and cytology to rule out malignant cells in CSF was recommended. ASA 325mg daily was also initiated with further stroke evaluation (carotid dopplers MR angiogram) to be completed. Past Medical History: 1.

There is no loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation seen. No hemorrhage identified. There is no evidence of dense middle cerebral artery. CT PERFUSION HEAD: CT perfusion of the head demonstrates a large defect within the right middle cerebral artery territory on mean transit time with a corresponding blood volume abnormality indicative of a large area of evolving infarct. CT ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: CT angiography of the head demonstrates complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery at the M1 region with subtle distal flow in the sylvian branches. The remaining arteries of anterior and the posterior circulation are patent. IMPRESSION: 1. CT angiography of the head demonstrates subacute infarct in the right parietal lobe seen on the previous MRI of [**2150-8-5**]. 2. Large perfusion defect in the middle cerebral artery region indicative of an evolving infarct. 3. CT angiography of the head demonstrates near complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery at M1 region with minimal distal flow as described above MRI/A: There is an acute right middle cerebral artery territorial infarct identified as seen on recent CTA examination. The infarct is evolving and involves the basal ganglia as well as the parietal and frontal and temporal cortices. There is no evidence of hemorrhage seen in this region. There are linear areas of susceptibility abnormalities identified in the right parietal cortex at the site of previously seen infarct on the MRI of [**2150-8-5**]. In addition, signal abnormalities are seen in the left parietal lobe and also along the medial aspect of the left parietal lobe on diffusion images, some of which were present on the previous MRI and could be subacute infarcts. However, the abnormalities in the medial aspect of the left parietal lobe on diffusion were not clearly seen on the previous study and could be interval infarcts but they are difficult to assess on ADC map secondary to motion. There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus identified. MRA HEAD: The head MRA demonstrates non-visualization of the right middle cerebral artery beyond its proximal M1 portion. There are no vascular structures identified in the sylvian region. The remaining arteries are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Acute right middle cerebral artery infarct without evidence of a hemorrhage with minimal mass effect. 2. Evolving subacute infarcts in both parietal lobes with new diffusion abnormality in the medial left parietal lobe could be also due to subacute infarcts but were not clearly visible on the prior MRI. Laminar necrosis with susceptibility abnormalities are seen in both parietal lobes at the site of previous infarcts. 3. MRA shows complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in the M1 region without visualization of the distal branches. TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. A patent foramen ovale is present. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Patent foramen ovale. CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: 1. The previously noted multiple liver metastases are not well visualized on this current late urographic phase study, but heterogeneity of the liver parenchyma suggests progression. 2. No source of gastrointestinal bleeding demonstrated. CAROTID ULTRASOUND: Bilateral ICA simple calcific plaque, no appreciable associated stenosis however (graded as less than 40% bilaterally). Brief Hospital Course: NEURO: At the time of presentation, his NIHSS was 22. He received iv tpa but it was stopped after several minutes once it became known that he had a prior stroke during early [**2150-8-5**]. There was no remarkable improvement in his examination. Patient was monitored in the ICU and there was no complications, with stable head CT at 24 hours. Patient was then transferred to floor. He still has a dense L-sided neglect with anosognosia and with his eyes not crossing the midline. Fluent. He was not opening his eyes till he received a direct command (and then did so with difficulty: ocular apraxia). However, he has clearly improved in this regard. He does have a PFO. His carotids show a plaque (<40%). CT brain on [**8-24**] did not show evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. On [**8-25**], ASA 81 qd was started. He was also given simvastatin 10 mg daily. There were no AF runs in his telemetry monitoring. ID: Patient was treated for UTI with 10 day course of ceftriaxone. GOALS OF CARE: We had extensive discussions with his family discussion about goals of care. The palliative care team was most helpful in this regard. He does not want a PEG placed. The speech and swallow evaluation determined he could have po feeds under 1 to 1 supervision. He will need to work with nutrition in the rehab setting, and be evaluated if he can maintain sufficient nutrition on his own. If this is not improving in the following weeks, the family may want to readdress the PEG tube issue, depending on his overall level of function at that time. Hospice care was also discussed with the family, and there will be a possibility for transition to hospice care from [**Hospital1 1501**].

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, IV/VI systolic ejection murmur. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds. Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Neurologic: Diminished strength in left upper and lower extremities. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2137-6-11**] for coronary artery bypass grafting times three and aortic valve repair. Her coronary artery bypass grafting grafts included a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery. Her aortic valve was evaluated and repaired via decalcification. The operation was completed without complications. The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, where she was weaned off trips and was hemodynamically monitored. She was extubated on postoperative day number one and stabilized. On postoperative day number two, the patient's chest tube was discontinued. Follow-up chest x-ray revealed a 38% to 40% pneumothorax and, consequently, a chest tube was reinserted. On postoperative day number three, after adequate fluid resuscitation and assurance of hemodynamic stability, the patient was transferred to the floor. That evening, she developed an acute onset of dysarthria, which lasted for approximately 30 to 40 minutes. She recovered from this event without residual deficit. She was evaluated with a head CT scan, which revealed no acute changes. She was also evaluated by neurology and vascular surgery, who did not recommend any change in her clinical care. She did not suffer from any further similar episodes during the remainder of her hospital course. On postoperative day number five, the patient's pacer wires were discontinued. Chest tube output was minimal and was consequently discontinued as well. A follow-up chest x-ray revealed no evidence of pneumothorax. The patient did well over the next several days and was monitored carefully. On postoperative day number six, urinalysis was consistent with a urinary tract infection, for which the patient was started on Levaquin. She remained afebrile and asymptomatic during this time. On postoperative day number eight, the patient was felt to be stable for transfer to a rehabilitation facility. Physical examination on discharge: Vital signs: Maximum temperature 98.7, current temperature 98.4, blood pressure 106,66, pulse 104, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation 96% in room air; weight was 74 kilograms, and input and output were satisfactory.

Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea: Patient was admitted to the CCU due to his hypotension requiring dopamine gtt. In the CCU he underwent dialysis with improvement in his symptoms. On the evening of admission, the patient was noted to be acutely unresponsive and turned blue. Telemetry revealed an initial rhythm of PEA then quickly converted to vfib. A code was called. During the code he was shocked several times, given epi, calcium, d5, insulin, and bicarb. He then had runs of VT and was shocked with that, with intermittent loss of pulse. ECG was c/w inferior STEMI. He was also given amiodarone 150 mg load and started on amio gtt. He had a bradycardia and was started on dopamine and transiently levophed. One etiology considered for his arrest was PE as he was blue from shoulders up at the beginning of code. Heparin gtt started for treatment of MI or PE. He was intubated and remained stable overnight on pressors. Given the concern for PE the patient underwent CTA which showed no evidence of clot. . # Hypotension: Following cardiac arrest the patient continued to require pressors for BP support. On [**5-20**] his hemodynamics continued to worsen requiring addition of more pressors for support. On EKG he had worsening ST elevations in the anterior leads. Given he was deemed to be not a surgical candidate he was continued on medical management. Over the course of the evening on [**5-20**] his status continued to worsen. He spiked a temp. to 102 and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed sepsis. During this time he had recurrent episodes of VT and was shocked for these with return to narrow-complex rhythm. Given his worsening status despite multiple pressors and recurrent arrythmias a discussion was had with the patient's wife and decision was made to make the patient DNR. He was made comfortable and expired at 5am on [**5-21**]. . #C.Diff - Continued on PO Vancomycin. . #)CAD - Medical managment of probable STEMI.

Around 4-5 weeks ago, she was in her normal state of good health when she developed shortness of breath asssociated with back pain. She treated the back pain with flexerol, it resolved, but the shortness of breath remained. Two weeks ago, she developed acutely worsening SOB over a 24hr period, and presented to her [**Known lastname 3390**]. [**Name10 (NameIs) 3390**] directed her to the ER given concern for PE; CTA-chest per report showing no embolus but liver nodules concerning for malignancy. Subsequent biopsy showed adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. No lung lesions identfied on multiple imaging. MRI of breast on [**2160-10-2**] revealed mass. Path of tumor showed it to be ER neg, PR neg, HER-2-neu positive, and oncologist decided to start chemo. Over the past couple of days prior to admission, per her friends, she had some confusion, with DOE that made climbing stairs difficult, and worsening jaundice. No chest pain. Recent weight gain from baseline 175 to 197 lbs. On the day of admission, she went to her oncologist's office for 1st round of chemotherapy herceptin and navelbine. She appeared jaundiced and was not oriented to place. While receiving chemo, she had chills, nausea and several episodes of emesis. According to the flow sheets, her oxygen saturations was in the 70s-80s. No chest pain, no itch. She developed an O2 requirement, EMS was called, and she was sent to [**Hospital3 **].

No bowel dilatation or bowel wall thickening to suggest bowel ischemia. 2. Small bilateral peripheral nodular opacities at the lung bases suggest an infectious etiology. Alternatively, this could represent metastatic disease. Correlation with outside examinations is recommended. Head CT: There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage on the right parietal lesion and a smaller one on the right frontal region. There is dissection into the right lateral ventricular system. There is substantial displacement of the atrium of the right lateral ventricle and substantial right to left subfalcine herniation. There is effacement of sulci and decreased density of the white matter diffusely consistent with diffuse cerebral edema. The region of the foramen magnum is not well assessed due to motion artifact but some transforaminal herniation is suspected. There is a small amount of blood in the posterior aspect of the left lateral ventricle. There is mild ventricular dilatation with slight prominence of the temporal horns. IMPRESSION: Extensive right-sided parenchymal hemorrhage with diffuse cerebral edema, a subfalcine herniation and probable transforaminal herniation. Brief Hospital Course: Pt was severely ill on admission to the ICU with a lactic acidosis, respiratory failure, and hepatic failure. She was given bicarbonate IV, broad spectrum antibiotics, 4 units of FFP for DIC. She was minimally sedated on propofol gtt but still was not responsive to painful stimuli. Because of her lactic acidosis, she had an abdominal CT to eval for bowel ischemia which was negative. She also had a head CT given her unresponsiveness, which demonstrated a large intracerebral hemorrhage with uncal herniation. At this point, a discussion was had with her HCP who stated that pt would not have wanted further invasive measures, such as neurosurgical intervention, and would rather be made comfortable. She was placed on a morphine gtt and extubated, and died peacefully with her friends by her side a few minutes later.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with advanced dementia and CAD s/p pacer here with acute aphasia and right hemiparesis s/p IV tPA. History of non-anticoagulated AF and proximal occlusion suspicious for cardioembolic source of infarction. Given that patient received IV thrombolysis, not deemed candidate for further endovascular therapy owing to time from deficit, partial recanalization after tPA, risk of hemorrhagic transformation. She was initially admitted to the ICU and unfortunately, the IV tPA did not work and she had dense L MCA infarct leaving her globally aphasic with dense R sided weakness. She had repeated swallow evaluations including video swallow which showed pureed diet with nectar thickened liquid is acceptable with some aspiration risk. She needs direct supervision with suction as needed per nursing for feedings. Although she has Afib, given the advanced dementia with fall risk and large infarct, no Coumadin was started during this admission. Coumadin should be re-discussed upon follow-up as outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]. Patient is on aspirin daily.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care Facility: [**Location (un) **] - [**Location (un) 620**] Discharge Diagnosis: L MCA stroke Advanced dementia Atrial fibrillation Discharge Condition: Stable - Dense right sided weakness with left gaze preference plus global aphasia. Discharge Instructions: You came in with acute left sided weakness and aphasia and found to have left MCA occlusion. Because you came in with significant deficit and you arrived within the window of time for thrombolytics, you received IV tPA and initially admitted to the ICU. Unfortunately, the thrombolytics did not work and you have an extensive, dense L MCA infarct causing you to have dense weakness of R side plus globally aphasic. Given your advanced age and dementia plus fall risk and large infarct, although you have atrial fibrillation, Coumadin was not started during this admission. It should be re-addressed when you follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient. You were evaluated per speech therapist and had video-swallow test which showed that you are able to swallow pureed solids with nectar thicked liquid but is at aspiration risk. Upon discussing with your family, it was decided that despite the aspiration risk, it would be better to give food by mouth rather than resort to PEG placement. You need strict supervision with feeding by nursing staff. Also, you were found to be MRSA positive with nasal swab during this admission. Please take meds as scheduled and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as scheduled.

Service: Medicine, [**Doctor Last Name **] Firm HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of thyroid cancer who is status post thyroidectomy in [**2148**], which was complicated by left vocal cord paralysis. On [**7-10**] of this year the patient underwent thyroplasty at [**State 350**] Eye & Ear Institute with medialization of the left vocal cord. On [**7-15**] of this year, the patient had increased edema of the vocal cords as well as tenderness and edema of the left side of her neck, and was subsequently admitted to the ENT Service at [**Hospital1 1444**]. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. End-stage renal disease secondary to lithium toxicity. 2. Crohn's disease. 3. Status post ileostomy. 4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with apparent restrictive picture. Pulmonary function tests from [**7-5**] revealed FVC of 53% or predicted, FEV1:FVC ratio of 98% or predicted, and an FEV1 of 52% or predicted. 5. Thyroid cancer, status post thyroidectomy in [**2148**] complicated by left vocal cord paralysis. 6. "Irregular heart beat." Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, history of ventricular ectopy. 7. Upper gastrointestinal bleed. 8. History of osteoporosis. 9. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy. ALLERGIES: PERCOCET, NEURONTIN, PROPULSID, MOTRIN, CLINDAMYCIN, KEFLEX, CIPROFLOXACIN, PENICILLIN. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Outpatient medications included Phos-Lo, lithium, Coumadin, albuterol, Nephrocaps, Miacalcin, Atrovent, Serevent, maprotiline, Prilosec, Premarin, Synthroid, Serax. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has never been married. She denies any drug or alcohol abuse. The patient has a 45-pack-year history of smoking; she quit three years ago. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: The patient vitals were noted to be as follows: Temperature 98.2, heart rate 74, blood pressure 112/60, respirations 24 per minute, satting 96% on 50% oxygen. Physical examination revealed a patient who somewhat uncomfortable. She exhibited audible stridor both on inspiratory and expiratory breathing. The patient's larynx was found to have swelling over the arytenoid, and there was swelling over the left arytenoid and diffuse erythema as well as general edema throughout both vocal cords. The neck was found to be soft and nontender. Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally with intermittent rales. RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: Chest x-ray on admission revealed the patient to be osteopenic. There was some question of possible tracheal deviation in the mediastinum, and the patient was thought to have a very very small pleural effusion on the left. LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: Complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 9.8, hemoglobin of 12.4, hematocrit of 44, platelets 280. INR 1.6. Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 137, potassium of 4.6, chloride of 98, bicarbonate of 22, BUN of 26, creatinine of 6.6, and glucose of 126. HOSPITAL COURSE: As mentioned above, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] ENT Service. She was given steroids and antibiotics. A bronchoscopy revealed her airway diameter to be approximately 3 mm, which was insufficient for intubation. Because the patient's neck edema, her Coumadin was briefly discontinued on [**2153-7-15**], and her right arm AV fistula subsequently clotted. On [**2153-7-17**], the patient was seen by transplant surgery who successfully reopened the patient's AV fistula. The patient received a short course of dialysis that day and received a full course of dialysis the following day. The patient was maintained on a heparin drip and was loaded with Coumadin in order to keep her AV fistula opened. On the morning of discharge, as mentioned above, the patient received a full course of dialysis. She also was seen by Interventional Radiology who performed a fistulogram which revealed that the patient had some stenosis in the central brachial vein at the site of the surgical patch. It was felt that this are would not be amenable to PTA because of the recent surgical intervention. It should be noted that initially the patient was under the care of the ENT Service and in the Intensive Care Unit because of her airway instability. However, following administration of steroids and antibiotics, her laryngeal and neck edema and tenderness decreased significantly such that she was felt to be stable enough to be transferred to the floor. The patient was transferred to the Medical Service on the evening of [**2153-7-17**], where her preoperative regimen was continued. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Laryngeal edema. 2. Thyroid cancer. 3. Status post thyroidectomy (in [**2148**] complicated by left vocal cord paralysis). 4. Status post thyroplasty (on [**2153-7-10**]) with medialization of left vocal cord. 5. End-stage renal disease secondary to lithium toxicity. 6. Crohn's disease. 7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 8. Bipolar disorder. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: The patient was discharged on her home medication regimen. This included the above-mentioned medications. The patient was also given prescriptions for azithromycin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times seven days. The patient received a prescription for Medrol dose pack as well. CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Upon discharge, the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. She had a blood pressure of 122/70, heart rate of 66, breathing 16 times per minute. Her temperature was 98.7 degrees. Laboratories on the morning of discharge included a complete blood count of 7.1 and a hematocrit of 44. On examination, the patient was noted to be watching television and receiving dialysis, in no acute distress. Her mucous membranes were moist. Her neck incision was clean, dry and intact with no increased swelling or erythema. Her heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rubs or gallops. Chest examination revealed good air movement bilaterally without wheezes. Abdominal examination revealed ileostomy to be in place without erythema or drainage. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended. Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP: The patient was to return to the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**] at [**Hospital1 69**] for dialysis in two days. She was to follow up with primary care physician for her underlying medical conditions.

Post-operative pneumocephalus. CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2190-3-13**] 1. Post left craniotomy changes, with unchanged subarachnoid blood products within the left frontoparietal, temporal and right frontal lobes. 2. Unchanged position of a right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter terminating at the right lateral ventricle. 3. No evidence of new hemorrhage or mass effect since the [**2190-3-12**] study. CT Head [**2190-3-15**] 1. Increasing areas of low attenuation and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white and white matter differentiation in the territory of the left MCA, may be secondary to evolving infarction or evolving edema adjacent to the hematoma. 2. Stable appearance of subarachnoid blood, without evidence of new hemorrhage. 3. Slight enlargement of the left frontal extra-axial collection beneath the left craniotomy changes. 4. Unchanged mass effect with 5.5 mm of rightward shift of the normal midline structures. No evidence of uncal herniation. CT Abd/Pelvis [**2190-3-15**] 1. No retroperitoneal hematoma, as clinically questioned. 2. Indeterminate 17-mm hypodense lesion within the left lobe of the liver. Ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation, non-emergently. 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis CTA Head [**2190-3-16**] 1. No evidence of vasospasm with symmetric, patent bilateral MCAs. 2. Metallic coil in unchanged position at the bifurcation of the M1 and M2 segments. A small residual aneurysm is likely present in this region. 3. Unchanged appearance of subarachnoid, intraparenchymal, and intraventricular hemorrhages. No new foci of hemorrhage are visualized. 4. Stable areas of low attenuation in the territory of the left MCA are most likely due to vasogenic edema from the surrounding hematomas, although an underlying evolving infarction cannot be totally excluded. 5. Unchanged position of the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter without evidence of hydrocephalus. 6. Unchanged post-surgical changes in the left frontal lobe CXR [**2190-3-16**] AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of [**2190-3-14**]. The patient remains intubated, ETT in unchanged position. A right-sided PICC line has now been adjusted and its tip is seen to terminate in the mid portion of the SVC. Nasogastric tube reaches well into the stomach where it is curled up as before. No interval changes are seen in the normal-appearing cardiovascular pulmonary status on this portable chest examination. CXR [**2190-3-17**] In comparison with the study of [**3-16**], the endotracheal tube appears to have been removed. Other monitoring and support devices remain in place. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs CTA [**2190-3-17**] 1. No evidence of vasospasm. Bilateral MCA are patent. 2. A coil pack is present in the left MCA bifurcation of M1 and M2 with a 3.5 mm dilatation just medial and superior to the coil pack likely representing residual aneursym. 3. Subarachnoid blood mildly decreased since the prior exam. 4. Stable left frontal intraparenchymal and intraventricular hematomas as well as stable left frontal subdural collection causing a stable mass effect with 7 mm midline shift to the right. 5. Stable areas of low attenuation in the territory of the left MCA are most likely due to vasogenic edema from the surrounding hematomas, although an underlying evolving infarction cannot be totally excluded. 6. Stable position of the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter without evidence of hydrocephalus. CT head [**2190-3-19**] Right common carotid artery arteriogram shows widely patent right internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery with no evidence of spasm. Left common carotid artery arteriogram shows that the left internal carotid artery, left anterior cerebral artery and left middle cerebral artery are patent with no evidence of spasm. The aneurysm is still patent with coils at the tip where the rupture site was. Left vertebral artery arteriogram shows that both PCAs are patent. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 35962**] underwent cerebral angiography which showed that there was no vasospasm. We did not treat the aneurysm on this setting since she would require Plavix for the stent and she still had a ventricular catheter in. After the ventricular catheter is removed, she will be brought back for definitive treatment of this aneurysm. CXR [**2190-3-20**] Previous mild pulmonary edema has almost resolved. Heterogeneous opacification in the infrahilar right lower lung could be residual edema and atelectasis or early pneumonia. Pleural effusion on the right is small if any. Heart size top normal. Nasogastric feeding tube ends in the stomach. Right PIC line ends close to the anticipated location of the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax CXR [**2190-3-21**] The right lower lobe opacity is again redemonstrated, concerning for infectious process in the right lower lobe. Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach. The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. CXR [**2190-3-22**] Tip of the right PIC line projects over the upper right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 2.5 cm to confidently place it in the low SVC. No endotracheal tube seen below C6, the upper margin of this film. Feeding tube is looped in the stomach. Minimal pulmonary edema has developed in the right lower lobe and the heart though still normal size is slightly larger. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions small if any. CT head [**2190-3-22**] 1. Decrease in residual intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and intraventricular hemorrhage with no new foci of hemorrhage. 2. Slight decrease in edema surrounding the left temporoparietal hematoma, although residual sulcal effacement and rightward shift of the normal midline structures persist. 3. Small amount of post-surgical pneumocephalus around the right ventriculostomy catheter, without evidence of hemorrhage. 4. Stable post-craniotomy changes with a decrease in size of the adjacent subdural and subgaleal hematomas [**2190-3-22**] LENS No evidence of right or left deep vein thrombosis. [**2190-3-23**] CT head FINDINGS: There is a right-sided ventriculostomy catheter through a right frontal burr hole approach. The catheter appears to course through the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle but terminates just lateral to the ventricle itself. A small amount of postoperative pneumocephalus is adjacent to the catheter and unchanged. The ventricles are unchanged in size. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. There is trace if any residual intraventricular hemorrhage. Again noted is a left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage which is unchanged in size with surrounding edema. There is mild rightward shift of the normal midline structures, measuring 5 mm (2, 16). This is unchanged from the prior exam. Residual subarachnoid hemorrhage is present in the left hemisphere. Persistent edema and cortical swelling of the left frontal and parietal lobes is noted as before. No new foci of blood are visualized. Hypodense areas in the left temporal lobe are again seen and may relate to a combination ischemic changes and edema. Post surgical left frontal craniotomy changes are stable. There is a small post-surgical subdural hematoma which is unchanged in size. Mineralization of the membrane is present. The small post-surgical subgaleal hematoma appears to be slightly smaller in comparison to the prior exam. There is mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus and an air-fluid level in the sphenoid sinus. These are unchanged. The mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of hydrocephalus. 2. Right ventriculostomy catheter courses through the right lateral ventricle but terminates just lateral to the ventricle. Correlate with catheter function and if the position is desirable/appropriate. Followup closely as clinically indicated. 3. Unchanged appearance of left intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage without evidence of new bleeding. 4. Stable post-surgical changes after left frontal craniotomy. CT [**2190-3-24**] FINDINGS: Since the prior study approximately 24 hours earlier, there has been no change in size of the ventricles. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. No intraventricular hemorrhage is identified. A ventriculostomy catheter through a right frontal burr hole is unchanged in position. It appears to course through the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle with the tip terminating just lateral to the ventricle within the parenchyma. This is unchanged since the prior exam. A small amount of postoperative pneumocephalus is adjacent to the catheter tract and also unchanged. The left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding vasogenic edema is unchanged from the recent exam. There is effacement of the adjacent sulci and mild, 3 mm, stable rightward shift of the normal midline structures. There is no evidence of uncal herniation. The basal cisterns are patent. Residual subarachnoid hemorrhage is present in the left hemisphere. No new foci of hemorrhage is identified. A metallic coil is present in the region of the left MCA with a slight amount of metallic streak artifact. Post-surgical changes from a left frontal craniotomy are unchanged. There is a small residual subdural hematoma with mineralization of the membrane. No fracture is identified. Mucosal thickening is present in the left maxillary sinus. The remainder of the paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged size of the ventricles, without evidence of hydrocephalus. 2. Unchanged position of the right ventriculostomy catheter, which appears to terminate just lateral to the right lateral ventricle. 3. Unchanged appearance of left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and post-surgical changes from left frontal craniotomy [**2190-3-26**] Cerebral angiogram Final Report DIAGNOSIS: Subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured left middle cerebral artery aneurysm. INDICATION: The patient had large hematoma of the left temporal lobe, the aneurysm was partially coiled and the hematoma evacuated. Following this, she was brought back for elective stent-assisted coiling. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left internal carotid artery arteriogram, left MCA stent-assisted coiling of left bifurcation aneurysm. Right common femoral artery arteriogram. ANESTHESIA: General. BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2190-3-30**] No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 35962**] was admitted to the Neurosurgery service and an emergent EVD was placed for developing hydrocephalus. She was then taken emergently for cerebral angiogram where preliminary embolization of the left MCA aneurysm was performed. Post angiog she was taken emergently to the operating room for a left craniotomy for evacuation of the left temporal clot. Post procedure she remained intubated. On POD 1 the patient remained in the ICU for close neuro monitoring. Her subgaleal drain was removed and staples were placed at the drain site. A repeat head CT was orderred secondary to a rise in her ICPs which showed post surgical changes and stable hemorrhage. Mannitol was given x 2 and a ICP bolt was placed. Overnight she had an increase in her ICP to low 30s which resolved independently. On [**3-14**], off sedation patient was purposeful in all 4 extremities, L>R. ICPs remained stable. She was stable into [**3-15**] and on morning rounds on [**3-15**] she was purposeful with her LUE and w/d in the other three LLE>RLE. On morning rounds on [**3-16**] she was more awake with Eye opening and otherwise her exam was stable. She underwent a CTA of the head which showed no vasospasm. TCD was repeated and also showed no vasospasm. Patient was weaned to extubate and bolt was removed. She was extubated on the evening of [**3-16**] and her tube feeds were restarted. She was also febrile to 101.4 and she was pancultured. On the morning of [**3-17**] was doign well off the ventilator and CSF was sent from her EVD for culture and lab testing. [**3-18**]; TCDs were performed that showed slower velocities and little evidence of vasospasm. She was taken off of Neo and her blood pressure was liberalized. Seroquel was started around the clock for delerium. [**3-19**]; She was agitated overnight and her EVD was dropped from 20 to 15. She also received a unit of PRBC's. Patient went to angio to rule out ongoing vasospasm. Her EVD was clamped afterwards but ICP's were elevated overnight and the drain was opened. She was extubated on [**3-20**], she had stridor that improved with nebulizer. Tm 100.7, and Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q12H started for + sputum. She continued to be restless and was aggitated. On [**3-21**], she was very alert, NICOTENE patch was strated for request for cigarretes. EVD to was at 20-and she seemed to be seems to be dumoping CSF fluid when moving and restless in bed. The ICU was weaning the seroquel due to EKG changes with QTC elevation. There was scant serous drainage from staple insertion site around the EVD cath. EVD was clogged and she was taken to the OR Sunday night to change out EVD. On [**3-22**], she was neuologically stable and the EVD was clamped. Sutures/staples were removed. She was seen by speach and swallow and was cleared for thin liquids and ground solids. She had low ICP's with a clamped drain on [**3-23**]. CT head was stable on [**3-23**] and [**3-24**]. The EVD was removed on [**3-24**]. She remained stable and was returned to the angiography suite on [**2190-3-26**] for completion of coil of left MCA aneurysm with stent assist. This was uneventful and she was started on asa and plavix. She remained in the ICU one more day and was transferred to floor status on [**3-27**]. She was impulsive and required supervision to prevent her from leaving the hospital. Her sutures and antibiotics were discontinued on [**3-29**]. Sceening LENS on [**3-30**] were negative. Seroquel was being weaned due to EKG changes. Keepra was stoppedo n [**4-1**]. UA was done for dysuria but was negative. She was denied coverage for acute rehab by [**Company 57702**]. She was being screened for a [**Hospital1 1501**]. On [**4-2**], seroquel was added for impulsive and aggressive behavior. Patient continued to attempt to leave hospital. She was denied [**Hospital1 1501**] and it was decided that patient is safe for discharge home with 24hr supervision. Her nimodipine was discontinued and patient was discharged home with daughter.

Relevant studies: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2195-2-18**]): No evidence of acute intra or extra-axial hemorrhage. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter differentiation appears preserved. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. There is partial opacification of the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, and nasopharynx in this intubated patient. No skull fractures are identified. There is moderate scalp soft tissue swelling, which has developed since the prior examination, and is most evident over both temporalis muscles. . CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST ([**2195-2-18**]): 1. Diffuse abnormality of the entire length of small bowel with fold and wall thickening and impressive wall edema. This is concerning for ischemic bowel, although no assessment can be made as to the patency of the mesenteric veins or arteries or the enhancement characteristics of the bowel mucosa. Notably, there is no pneumatosis, and no portal venous gas is identified. 2. Patchy opacities in both lower lobes. 3. 5 mm renal stone. . UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT ([**2195-2-18**]): Normal compressibility, color flow, and Doppler waveforms are seen in the deep venous system from the right common femoral vein to the right popliteal. The left common femoral vein is also normal. . ECHO ([**2195-2-20**]): The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 40-50 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No vegetations seen on any valve. Compared with the findings of the prior report (images reviewed) of [**2195-1-27**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is increased. The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested. . BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS ([**2195-2-24**]): Color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. Normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms are demonstrated. Intramural thrombus is not identified. . ECHO ([**2195-2-25**]): No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-2-20**], biventricular function has improved. . RENAL U.S. ([**2195-3-6**]): The right kidney measures 12.6 cm. The left kidney measures 11.1 cm. The kidneys are diffusely increased in echogenicity, unchanged since the prior study. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. In the lower pole of the left kidney is a 7-mm anechoic thin-walled cyst consistent with a simple cyst. The previously identified 5 mm right renal stone seen on a CT from [**2195-2-18**] is not identified on this study. The bladder wall appears somewhat irregular, but lumen is not fully distended making this difficult to interpret. Small amount of ascites seen along the lateral margin of the liver, incompletely characterized. . CT TRACHEA W/O C W/3D REND ([**2195-3-8**]): There is high-attenuation material within the esophagus with Hounsfield units 60 consistent with blood given the patient's history of upper GI bleed. An area of irregularity is seen on the posterior tracheal wall, best demonstrated on series 3, image 55. A small tubular fistula is demonstrated. There is high- attenuation material with air bubbles seen within the posterior trachea. This is approximately 1.75 cm above the carina and is concerning for tracheoesophageal fistula. The lobar bronchi remain patent. Multiple high- attenuation (41.5 H) parenchymal consolidations are noted bilaterally which may be consistent with aspiration of hemorrhagic products, infection, or ARDS. There are bilateral pleural effusions. The osseous structures are unremarkable. Incidental note is made of a left sided subclavian central venous catheter. . DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL ([**2195-3-13**]): The liver is normal in echotexture without focal hepatic lesions. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation; the common bile duct is 4 mm in diameter. The gallbladder is not distended and there is no evidence of stones or sludge within its lumen. The portal vein is patent with flow in an appropriate direction. Note is made of bilateral pleural effusions and a small to moderated amount of ascites in the right upper quadrant. The spleen appears unremarkable. Color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the hepatic veins, portal veins, inferior vena cava, hepatic arteries, splenic vein, and superior mesenteric vein demonstrate normal flow and waveforms. . MRCP ([**2195-3-18**]): 1. Markedly limited examination due to patient motion and patient body habitus (large effusions, apparent anasarca). 2. Large bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary consolidation. 3. No obvious biliary dilatation. Suspected tiny cysts within the right lobe of the liver, which are incompletely evaluated. 3. Apparent diffuse anasarca. 4. Probable cyst, lower pole right kidney. . CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2195-3-23**]): 1. Diffuse areas of septal thickening, ground glass attenuation and patchy consolidation show overall slight improvement compared to [**2195-3-8**]. This may be due to edema, infection, or ARDS. 2. Worsening atelectasis in right middle lobe. 3. Peribronchiolar opacities within right lower lobe, concerning for active infection involving the small airways. 4. Large pleural effusions, slightly increased compared to prior study. 5. Diffuse anasarca. . BILAT UP EXT VEINS US ([**2195-4-1**]): [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] were performed of the upper extremities bilaterally. Left-sided PICC line is noted. There is normal compressibility, flow, augmentation, and waveforms of the internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and cephalic veins bilaterally. Brief Hospital Course: 1. IDDM: Patient has known insulin depedent diabetes and was initially admitted with hypoglycemic coma. He was treated with Glucagon and dextrose infusions, and admitted to the ICU. While in the ICU, he was placed on an insulin drip for glycemic control, and converted to Glargine and RISS at the time of transfer to the floor. On the floor, he experienced recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, and was transferred back to the ICU on [**3-5**], where Lantus was held and changed to NPH. He experienced recurrent isolated hypoglycemic events, treated with D5 as needed. NPH was changed back to glargine prior to discharge, and patient's blood sugars remained under relatively stable control. While on TPN, regular insulin was added to his TPN. . 2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: His respiratory failure was felt to be multifactorial. He was intubated in the emergency department for airway protection and hypoxemia with ABG 7.21/28/58. His initial CXR was remarkable for a LLL infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia, and he was empirically treated with Zosyn (10-day course, completed on [**2-28**]). Subsequent CXRs showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates suggestive of possible aspiration +/- CHF +/- ARDS, with effusions. A thoracentesis was performed on [**2-25**] with studies consistent with a transudative effusion. He was succesfully extubated, and remained stable from a respiratory standpoint despite persistent findings of multifocal opacities on CXR. . While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for his upper GI bleed, he was also noted to have occasional hemoptysis and the possibility of a TE fistula was raised. A CT trachea obtained on [**3-8**] was also concerning for a TE fistula, and he was taken for a combined rigid bronchoscopy and EGD on [**3-10**] which showed no TE fistula and normal airways. . On [**3-19**], he had a rising temperature, tachycardia, and increasing oxygen requirements. Given concern for recurrent aspiration pneumonia, he was restarted on Zosyn and completed a 7 day course ending on [**3-26**]. . 3. Cardiac: While in hospital, he had an MB leak to 27, with stable mildly elevated troponins (albeit in the setting of renal failure). Whereas the possibility of NSTEMI was raised, it did not appear to be consistent with such an event. He was initially placed on ASA, which was subsequently held given his upper GI bleed. An echocardiogram obtained on [**2195-2-25**] showed improved EF versus prior with EF 50-55%, without WMA. Further cardiac evaluation was not pursued. . 4. Anasarca: His anasarca is likely multifactorial, with contributions from hypoalbuminemia secondary to malnutrition and nephrotic-range proteinuria. His mild systolic dysfunction was not thought large contributor. While in the ICU, he was diuresed with a Lasix drip. This was changed to intravenous boluses, and eventually to PO lasix. At the time of discharge, he was on Diuril 250 PO BID, with lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **]. He was also started on lisinopril for renal protective effects. . 5. Chronic diarrhea: An initial CT abdomen obtained in the emergency department was remarkable for diffuse bowel wall edema. The possibility of mesenteric ischemia was raised, but felt unlikely in the setting of normal lactate. He was initially empirically started on Zosyn and Flagyl. An infectious work-up was performed and negative, with stool cultures, O&P, and C. diff X 3 negative. Flagyl was discontinued on [**2-23**] (5-day course). He was placed on bowel rest while in the ICU, with TPN. . Review of his prior history revealed chronic diarrhea, and prior colonoscopies with biopsies negative for sprue. Given a peripheral eosinophilia, strongyloides antibody and TTG were sent, both of which returned negative. The case was reviewed with GI, and diabetic enteropathy is felt to be the leading diagnosis. . 6. GI bleed: On [**3-7**], he developed hematemesis with repeated vomiting of bright red blood. An NG tube was placed, with positive NG lavage that did not clear with NS. He was transferred to the ICU for further management. An EGD performed on [**3-7**] showed a large clot occupying the entire esophagus, but the bleeding site could not be visualized. A repeat EGD on [**3-8**] revealed similar findings. Another EGD on [**3-10**] showed severe esophagitis, without active bleeding, felt to be the source of his recent bleed. Biopsy was not performed, for fear of precipitating further bleeding. He was transfused a total of 13 units of PRBCs while hospitalized. He was given a PPI drip while in the unit. He was continued on IV bolus PPI [**Hospital1 **] prior to being changed to [**Hospital1 **] PO PPI. He was transferred back to the floor on [**3-11**]. On [**3-13**], he had a milder recurrent upper GI bleed. An NG tube was placed, and he was transfued 1U for Hct drop. His NG tube was eventually removed on [**3-15**], and his diet slowly advanced. At the time of discharge he was tolerating a soft diet without further bleeding. He was given instructions to continue a PPI [**Hospital1 **] and carafate. He was also scheduled to return for a repeat EGD with biopsy. . 6. Polysubstance abuse: His initial tox screen was positive for cocaine, and a repeat urine tox screen on [**3-4**] was again positive for cocaine despite patient denial. Repeat tox screen on [**3-14**] was negative. . 7. Renal failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 4610**] has known baseline chronic renal insufficiency attributed to DM nephropathy and IgA nephropathy, with baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3. At the time of admission, his creatinine was noted to be elevated at 2.1, and peaked at 3.4 on [**2195-3-3**], with subsequent slow improvement. As discussed above, he was started on an ACE-I for proteinuria. At the time of discharge, his creatinine was stable around 2.0 . 8. Abnormal LFTs: While in the hospital, he was noted to have intermittent elevated transaminases, with persistently elevated ALP with periodic rise. Hepatology was consulted, and an extensive work-up was recommended. A RUQ U/S was obtained on [**3-13**], remarkable for normal liver texture, and no biliary pathology. An MRCP performed on [**3-18**] was limited by patient motion, but did not show any gross pathology. Hepatitis serologies, HCV VL, HIV, CMV, ceruloplasmin, AMA and [**Doctor First Name **] were all negative. EBV IgG was positive with negative IgM. He appeared to have baseline abnormalities, and his periodic exacerbations appeared to be associated with TPN. His Atorvastatin was discontinued on [**3-13**]. . 9. Dental caries: Patient had complaints of tooth pains. In the setting of fevers and leukocytosis without known source, a dental consult was called to rule out tooth abscess. There was no evidence for acute infection, but several caries were identified for extraction. He was discharged with instructions to follow up for outpatient extractions. . 10. Prophylaxis: He received a [**Hospital1 **] PPI and SQ heparin prophylaxis. . 11. Code: Full . 12. Access: A PICC was placed [**2195-3-5**] and replaced on [**2195-3-12**]. A right IJ CVL was placed on [**2195-3-8**] and pulled on [**3-12**].

Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: gangrenous toe Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lower extremity angiogram with balloon angioplasty and placement of stent History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 39714**] is an 89yo gentleman with dementia, PVD, diastolic CHF, and AFib on coumadin admitted for work-up of gangrenous toe and mental status changes. Of note, he had been taking increased doses of percocet for the painful foot, and he had been increasingly withdrawn in the setting of his son's death on [**5-6**]. Shortly after admission to the floor, he was noted to be unresponsive except to sternal rub; ABG was 7.07/120/225. A Code Blue was called, and the patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. In the MICU, he was found to be febrile; cultures were significant for a positive UA, and he was started on cipro. He self-extubated himself during a spontaneous breathing trial and did well without need for reintubation. Per his family, his mental status at baseline is that he responds to questions but is not oriented.

CT Head [**2190-5-21**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Unchanged low-attenuation areas in the subcortical white matter and focal low attenuations likely consistent with small vessel disease and lacunar ischemic changes. Persistent and unchanged right frontal subcortical area of low density, likely consistent with sequela of an old ischemic event. If there is no clinical contraindication, MRI of the head with diffusion-weighted sequences may provide better characterization of these findings. RUQ Ultrasound [**5-21**]: 1. Cholelithiasis with no signs of cholecystitis. 2. Trace of ascites. 3. Atrophic kidneys. Renal US [**5-24**]: 1. Bilateral atrophic kidneys without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi. 2.

Increasing moderate right pleural effusion. LE Angiogram [**5-27**]: 1. Access was obtained in a treograde fashion in teh right common femoral artery. AN omniflush catheter was advanced to the level of L2/L3 and a dstal abdominal aortogram was prefromed. The abdominal aorta had moderate diffuse disease. The renal arteries were poorly seen. The RCIA, IIA and EIA were patent. The RCFA was patent and teh RLE was not imaged beyond that point. The LCIA, EIA and IIA were patent as was the L CFA. The LSFA had a 70% stenosis. The ominiflush catheter was then advanced over the [**Doctor Last Name 534**] over an angled gluide wire and selective angiography of the LLE was preformed. The popliteal artery was patent with mild diffuse disease. There was a high grade stenosis of the TPT and the AT and the PT were 100% occluded. There were diffuse high grade stenoses of the peroneal artery. The left DP and foot filled via collaterals from the PA artery. 2. Successful PTA of the L PA with a 3.0 balloon. Final angiography revealed a 20% residual stenosis and no dissection. (See PTA comments) 3. Successful stenting of the LSFA with a 6.0 x 60 mm protege stent which was post dilate dto 6.0 with a admiral balloon. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and normal flow. (See PTA comments) FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Peripheral vascular disease. 2. Stenting of the LSFA. 3. Successful PTA of the L PA Brief Hospital Course: 89yo gentleman with dementia, HTN, PVD, CAD, AFib (s/p PPM for tachy-brady syndrome), and CKD who admitted with gangrenous toe, found to have mental status changes upon arrival to the floor. # Mental status change/Hypercarbic respiratory failure Shortly after admission to the hospital floor, the patient was noted to be obtunded. An ABG showed significant hypercarbia to 120 and a code blue was called. The patient was intubated and transferred to the MICU for further care. Within 48 hours of intubation, the patient self-extubated during a spontaneous breathing trial and did well on his own; he did not require re-intubation. The precipitating event for his hypercarbic respiratory failure was unclear. A CT of his head did not show any acute event. It was noted that he had been taking increasing doses of percocet just prior to his presentation, and there was concern that he might have had narcotic induced hypoventilation. Through the rest of his course, his mental status was oriented to person only. He responded to most simple questions. His family felt that he was at his baseline. # Fevers: The patient was febrile on [**5-22**], shortly after presentation to the MICU. His cultures were significant for Citrobacter freundi in his urine. He was started on ciprofloxacin for his UTI on [**5-22**] x a 2 week course to be completed [**6-4**]. His blood cultures were negative. Although subsequent CXRs were read as possible pneumonia, his fevers resolved with treatment of his UTI and he did not have clinical manifestations of pneumonia. Upon review of his prior chest films and CT chest, he has a long history of nodules and pulmonary opacities due to silicosis. # Acute Renal Failure on Chronic Renal Insufficiency/ Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient's baseline creatinine ranges 1.5-2.0. At the time of admission, his Cr was 2.5. His diuretics were held and he was given several liters of fluid in the MICU and transfused one unit of pRBCs. Renal ultrasound showed no evidence of obstruction. His creatinine improved to 1.4 prior to his cath and was 1.5 on the day of discharge. Although he initially appeared dehydrated on admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 39714**] developed lower extremity edema and crackles on his exam in the setting of receiving IV fluids for ARF and prior to his catheterization. He was kept in the hospital after the angiogram for diuresis. He was given IV lasix and then transitioned to PO lasix. His home lasix dose was increased from 40mg daily to 80mg daily to continue diuresis for his lower extremity edema. **His blood will be drawn [**6-2**] and a BUN/Cr should be sent to his primary care doctor so that his dose of lasix can be adjusted as appropriate. He will likely need to be put back on 40mg lasix daily once his lower extremity has improved.** # Gangrenous left big toe/Peripheral vascular disease: After the patient's renal function returned to baseline, he was brought to the cath lab and underwent LE angiography with balloon angioplasty and a stent to his LSFA. He was continued on aspirin and plavix was started. There was no evidence of infection in his lower extremities. He had recently completed 2 weeks of keflex prior to his admission. Wound care was provided per wound care nursing recommendations. The patient should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. # Hypertension: Mr. [**Known lastname 39714**] developed hypertensive urgency during his hospital stay. The trigger for his elevated BPs was not clear, though his systolic blood pressure was noted to be elevated 150s-170s even before he became acutely hypertensive to 200 and was transferred to the CCU. His pressures were acutely controlled with hydralazine. His metoprolol was increased and he was started on norvasc. At the time of discharge, his blood pressures were greatly improved on this regimen with systolic pressures in the 130s to 150s. His blood pressure regimen should continue to be adjusted as needed as an outpatient. # Transaminitis: Patient was noted to have a transaminitis upon admission. He had a RUQ ultrasound that showed gallstones but no evidence of cholecystitis. His transaminitis resolved with IV fluids and his ALT/AST were normal at the time of discharge. # Anemia: Patient's Hct was stable at 28-31. He received 1 unit of packed red cells in the setting of ARF while he was in the MICU with an appropriate increase in his Hct. His iron supplementation was continued. # Coronary artery disease: There was no evidence of active coronary disease. His ASA, atorvastatin, and metoprolol were continued. # History of Atrial fibrillation: Patient is s/p PPM for tachybrady syndrome. He was V-paced on telemetry. His coumadin was initially held in anticipation of angiography. At the time of discharge, his coumadin was restarted. His INR will be drawn on Wednesday to allow his coumadin to be adjusted as needed since he is being sent home on ciprofloxacin, which interacts with coumadin. # Dementia/Delirium: After his extubation, the patient was felt to be at his baseline as discussed above. His valproate, which he takes at home for behavioral control, was continued. His wife was advised to avoid narcotics because of the concern that the percocet had been responsible for his hypoventilation. # Neurotic excoriations on neck: Dermatology was consulted for ulcerated lesions on the patient's neck and head. They felt that he had neurotic excoriations and that the lesions would heal if he would stop picking at them. He was given mitts to wear and the sores should be covered with vaseline and then gauze to help prevent him from scratching them. # Gout: continued allopurinol # Nutrition: Soft/dysphagia diet with nectar thickened liquid per speech and swallow # Code: full (confirmed with wife) # Dispo: He was discharged to home, where he has 24 hour care as well as a hospital bed and VNA. # Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) 382**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39715**]. # Note that the following medication changes were made: - increased metoprolol to 150mg daily - increased lasix to 80mg daily*** Please note that this dose will probably need to be decreased down to 40mg daily in the next week. - started norvasc (amlodipine) 5mg daily - started plavix (clopidogrel) 75mg daily - started ciprofloxacin 500mg twice a day for 5 more days to treat urine infection (last day to take is [**6-4**]) - stop taking percocet or oxycodone as these medications may have been responsible for making your breathing dangerously slow.

Service: NEUROSURGERY Allergies: Morphine Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5084**] Chief Complaint: refractory epilepsy Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2167-8-13**]: Left craniotomy left temporal lobectomy History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 805**] is a 42yo gentleman who has been followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an epileptologist for several years now and also had a VNS placed, which has not given him much relief of his seizures, which are located by several different convergent pieces of data including imaging and physiological EEG monitoring studies to be in the left temporal mesial area. He is a good candidate for a standard left temporal lobectomy, but he was worried previously about speech or language difficulties following surgery. He has progressed with his refractory seizure picture and has reached a point where he feels that it would be better for him to undergo the surgery at this point, especially with the lack of benefit from the vagus nerve stimulator. We talked about whether this would be left in or not. My recommendation would be to leave it in but turn it off following the surgery and leave it off until we can assess the overall outcome from the resective surgery itself. I went over the risks and benefits and details of this with him and we will plan a left temporal lobectomy with an amygdala hippocampectomy in the standard way Past Medical History: Refractory temporal lobe epilepsy Depression Asthma Kidney stones s/p T11-T12 and L5-S1 spinal fusion Social History: divorced, lives alone, no tobacco/etoh/drugs. works as a speech & language therapist Family History: There is no family history of epilepsy or febrile seizures. His paternal uncle has [**Name (NI) 3832**] syndrome, his maternal grandfather had an MI at ages 50 and 70, his mother has breast cancer. Physical Exam: At time of discharge: moves lle/lue spontaneously, r hemiplegic, no spon movement rue/rle. no w/d to pain but has sensory in R side. speech improving, able to say name and answer simple questions with yes/no Pertinent Results: [**8-13**] NCHCT: Status post left temporal lobectomy. Hypodensity within the left inferior parietal and occipital lobes suggests edema; infarction cannot be excluded. [**8-13**] EEG:This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of the presence of slowing broadly present broadly over the left hemisphere and loss of fast frequency predominantly in the mid-posterior temporal region on the left. There were a few bursts of generalized slowing suggesting some deep midline compromise. No interictal or sustained epileptic activity was seen. [**8-13**] CTA Head: 1. Hypodensity in the left occipital lobe with cutoff of the left posterior cerebral artery just distal to the P1 segment. These findings may reflect occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery with developing infarct in the occipital lobe. 2. Expected postoperative changes status post left temporal lobectomy, with slightly increased hemorrhage within the surgical cavity. [**8-13**] MRI Brain: 1. Acute infarct in the left occipital lobe and left thalamus as well as within the posterior limb of the internal capsule, corona radiata and insula. The extent of findings is less than on the CT; CT findings may therefore reflect a combination of edema and post-operative swelling. 2. Expected postoperative findings of left temporal lobectomy, with hemorrhage within the operative bed. [**8-14**] CT Head: 1. Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction and hypodense left occipital lobe consistent with evolving, known left PCA infarct. 2. New moderate to severe left cerebral edema with effacement of the left lateral ventricle and new midline shift to the right by 7 mm. [**8-14**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of asymmetric background with relative slowing over the left centro-temporal regions with loss of faster frequencies temporally suggestive of focal cortical dysfunction. There are intermittent bursts of generalized slowing suggestive of some deep midline compromise. No interictal or electrographic seizures are seen. MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2167-8-18**] 1. Interval enlargement of the large acute infarction in the left cerebral hemisphere, as detailed above, with increased mass effect and rightward shift of midline structures. 2. The temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle has slightly increased in size, likely due to increased compression of the third ventricle, concerning for impending trapping. 3. Small foci of hemorrhagic transformation in the left thalamus, and possibly also in the left occipital lobe. However, the left occipital hemorrhagic focus may be chronic. CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2167-8-22**] 1. Evolving left PCA infarction with increased hypodensity involving parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and thalamus. Mixed density in the left occipital lobe may represent hemorrhagic conversion. 2. Stable shift of midline structures to the right, approximately 5 mm. Quadrigeminal plate cistern remains patent BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2167-8-22**] No evidence of DVT in either left or right lower extremity. Brief Hospital Course: Pt was electively admitted and underwent a Left craniotomy and left temporal lobectomy. Surgery was without complication. He was extubated and upon awakening was noted to be aphasic and to have right hemiplegia. He was taken for a stat Head CT and then was transferred to the ICU. CT was concerning for possible infarct so a Stroke Neurology consult was called. They recommended EEG, CTA and MRI. These were all performed. The patient was reintubated [**8-13**] PM due to poor neurological exam and airway protection. CE's remained negative. On [**8-14**] his R pupil was noted to be dilated to 8mm but still reactive. He was given a dose of decadron and it came down to 5mm while the left remained at 4mm. Repeat Head CT revealed L PCA infarct, new L edema with MLS & mass effect. Family was updated. On [**8-15**], a swallow evaluation was ordered. On [**8-17**], patient expressed sucidial ideations and psych was consulted. They recommended increasing his zoloft dosing and add remeron qhs. Swallow evaluation resulted in "sips" of small spoonfulls of nectar thick liquid as tolerated w/ 1:1 sitter. Continue non-oral means of nutrition, meds and hydration. MRI head was performed which confirmed L hemispheric infarct. On [**9-19**], no changes were seen in patient. He remained in ICU awaiting a floor bed. On [**8-20**], patient was transferred to the floor. On [**8-21**], calorie counts were started to evaluate patient's food intake and necessity for PEG. Patient has low urine output and received 500cc bolus of NS. U/A was sent and was positive for UTI, he was started on ceftriaxone. On [**8-22**], patient removed dophoff and attempts to replace were unsuccessful. While attempting to give POs, it was noted that patient was pocketing food and aspirating. Chest x-ray was done which revealed atelectasis and question of new L retrocardiac opacity. Patient was made NPO and speech and swallow was reconsulted. On [**8-23**], patient continued to be agitated. On [**8-24**], patient reported abdominal pain in which GI was consulted for. He was started on emperic treatment for [**Female First Name (un) **], if no success, then he would need an EGD. On [**8-25**], patient reported severe itching, he was prescribed benadryl and sarna lotion to help relieve these symptoms. Dilaudid was also discontinued for fear of adverse reaction. LFTs were ordered while patient on fluconazole. On [**8-26**] his diet was advanced. A family meeting was held and rehab placement was discussed. On [**8-27**] his affect was improved and more interactive. Gabapentin was increased per Neurology's recommendations. On [**8-28**] he was seen and examined and his speech was slightly improved. The Neurology team also evalauted him and agreed that his exam has improved gradually. He was screened for rehab on [**8-28**] and was accepted to [**Hospital1 **] in [**Location (un) 86**]. The patient and family were in agreement with this plan and he was subsequently discharged to rehab in the afternoon of [**8-28**] with instructions for followup. All questions were answered regarding his plan of care prior to discharge.

Patient was in her usual state of health until yesterday when she began feeling unwell, was having chills, abdominal pain and nausea, and decided to go to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital. At AGH a RUQ U/S revealed intrahepatic biliary duct dilation and CT abd/pel revealed an obstructing mass in the head of the pancreas. On admission she was found to have AST 569, ALT 255 and normal WBC. On HD 2 this increased to 27 and 4/4 bottles of blood cultures became positive for GNR's. She had been started on Unasyn on admission but this was changed to Zosyn after the cultured came back (+) and she was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.

Dilated common bile duct with evidence of either distal narrowing or extrinsic compression. Biliary stent was placed. Minimal opacification of the remainder of the biliary tree was performed given concern for cholangitis. ERCP ([**2134-9-17**]): A plastic stent previously placed in the biliary duct was found in the major papilla. A small sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a needle-knife over previously placed plastic biliary stent. The plastic stent was then removed with a snare and sent for cytology. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. A single stricture that was approximately 1cm long was seen contained in the intra-ampullary portion of the CBD. Two round stones ranging in size from 5 mm to 6 mm were seen at the biliary tree. An extension sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. The two stones and some sludge were extracted successfully using a balloon catheter. Excellent drainage of bile and contrast was noted. Extensive cold forceps biopsies were performed of the ampulla for histology. It is possible that the stricture may be due to inflammation and scarring related to stone passage, however, this will not explain the mass seen on CT scan. Since the intra-ampullary stenosis was completely opened with the sphincterotomy with excellent drainage, there was no need to place another stent. Brief Hospital Course: 1. E. COLI SEPSIS: Pansensitive E coli, cultures grown from outside hospital. The patient was on antibiotics but had low grade temperatures even following initial ERCP with plastic stent placement in an area of stenosis related to a pancreatic head mass. She underwent a second ERCP on [**9-17**] which revealed new gallstones in the common bile duct. She underwent a sphincterotomy which relived this obstruction. Following this procedure her LFTs increased and slowly trended downward. A course of ciprofloxacin was completed. 2. PANCREATIC MASS: Initial brushings with atypical cells. Repeat brushings and biopsy from [**9-17**] showed inflammation but no evidence of malignancy. Given that the patient and family would likely not pursue any further work-up should this be a cancer, further evaluation (e.g. CT abdomen) was deferred. 3. CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF: Given sepsis lasix and lisinopril initially were held. Following reintroduction of these medications at her home doses she became hypotensive to an SBP of 80 and had acute renal failure with a Cr of 1.7. She was treated with IVF. Eventually after holding diuretics and with 2 units of FFP on [**9-17**] she became dyspneic and had pulmonary edema, she was given 40mg IV lasix on [**9-19**] and transitioned to her home dose of lasix 40mg po daily on [**9-20**]. Her lisinopril was not reintroduced given hypotension. She also experienced morning dyspnea on [**9-22**] and [**9-23**] for which QHS MS Contin was introduced; this decreased the symptomatic dyspnea. 4. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with AF on coumadin. INR 2.2 on admission, coumadin held for ERCP and restarted post ERCP. At discharge, INR was 1.4. 5. LOWER EXTREMITY JOINT PAINS: likely secondary to osteoarthritis, worsened secondary to immobility as well as to infection / fevers. This improved with physical therapy and with treatment of infection but the patient will require further physical therapy upon discharge to improve mobility to the point at which she can become independent again. Gabapentin, lidocaine patch and tramadol were started (allergy to tylenol and ibuprofen) with improvement in her symptoms, in addition she had low dose morphine for breakthrough pain.

Service: NEUROLOGY Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**] Chief Complaint: Intracranial bleed Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG tube placement w/ endoscopy History of Present Illness: 87 year-old French Creole speaking man with a history of HTN, Parkinson's disease was transferred from OSH with lethargy, difficulty speaking for 1 day and head CT with left basal ganglia hemorrhage for further management. Son reports that pt was fine when he went to bed Tuesday evening [**10-20**]. About 9:30AM [**10-21**], daughter-in-law woke pt up and noted that he had trouble sitting up, and was not speaking right. She put him back to bed and called pt's son. When son saw him, he was speaking gibberish, but did seem to understand what son was saying to him. Son gave him oatmeal and juice, which he seemed to swallow OK. Per son, there have been 2 similar episodes in the last few months, and they took pt to see doctor both times. By time had arrived at doctor's office, symptoms had resolved. Therefore, yesterday when this occurred, they simply put him back to bed. By 5:30pm yesterday, pt's symptoms had not resolved, and he reportedly said "I can't talk" so family called 911 and pt taken to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital. At OSH, pt's BP 210s/110s on arrival. Exam with lethargy. head CT showed left basal ganglia bleed. He was given 1gm dilantin, and received IV labetalol 10mg x4 for BP control, though was still in 200s for most of stay. Labs with negative cardiac enzymes, INR 1.2. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. On arrival, BP 200/100, given 10 labetalol x1 and started on nipride gtt with good effect. Repeat labs here with INR 1.4 so no blood products given. Repeat head CT essentially stable. Past Medical History: HTN Parkinsons Ds Social History: Lives with son and daughter-in-law. Quit tobacco >30yrs ago. No EtOH. Family History: Daughter died MI age 60. No stroke. Physical Exam: T 97.0 BP 191/99-->140s/90s HR 69 RR 14 O2 99% 2L NC General: Thin elderly man, in no acute distress HEENT: NC/AT Sclera anicteric Neck: Supple Lungs: Clear to auscultation anterolaterally CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no murmur. Abd: Soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Extr: No edema, warm Neurologic Examination: Mental Status: Very lethargic, some minimal eye opening to voice, especially son's. Looks at son bilaterally, otherwise does not follow commands. No obvious neglect Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 2 mm bilaterally in dark, brisk. Unable to visualize fundi. Eyes cross midline in both directions. Corneal present but decreased on right. Right facial droop but does grimace to nasal tickle bilaterally.

Cerebral atrophy, probably c/w age-related changes. Some chronic microvascualr changes periventricularly as well. --- CXR [**10-27**]:A nasogastric tube remains in place, terminating below the diaphragm. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. As noted previously, there is probably a hiatal hernia present. There is interval worsening of opacity in the left lower lobe as well as interval increase in size of a small left pleural effusion. There is new patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region. The bibasilar pulmonary opacities may be due to aspiration in the setting of an apparent hiatal hernia. Brief Hospital Course: 87yo M h/o HTN, Parkinson's disease presented with difficulty speaking and increased lethargy to OSH. Workup there revealed left basal ganglia bleed. Neuro: Initial exam showed right arm and face paresis and increased tone in the right arm. Also, he was very lethargic and not following commands or speaking. Likely cause of bleed was hypertension, given location and PMH. Etiology of decreased alertness was less clear as CT showed only mild surrounding edema, no mass effect or midline shift, and initial labs did not suggest metabolic derangement. His dose of Sinemet was increased in the first several days of his admission as it was thought that his increased tone and bradykinesia could be attributed to his Parkinsonism. However, he became increasingly lethargic, and Sinemet was reduced to his home dose w/ a response in his mental status back to his baseline. He has a history of lethargy w/ higher doses of sinemet in the past. Additionally, he was found to have aspiration pneumonia and a UTI, which likely attributed to his lethargy. He had a repeat head CT on [**10-22**] which showed resolving hemorrhage. Dilantin was loaded but not continued - no evidence of seizures during this admission. His neuro exam on the day of discharge showed that he is intermittently alert, w/ appropriate verbal responses to his son (at times, speech still garbled). He is able to follow commands, moves fingers and toes spontaneously; cannot protrude tongue. R arm flaccid but bradykinetic and rigid in remaining extremities; attends to both sides, and has blink reflex. +cogwheeling on LUE. no spasticity; withdrawals to pain stimulus. He has had very slow improvement of his symptoms, and he is still unable to swallow. He will need intensive physical therapy and support but may not be able to return to baseline (which his son reports as ambulation w/o assistance). Pt should continue Sinemet, have BP control, and f/u w/ his neurologist in the next few months. His anticoagulation and ASA were held during admission and not restarted. On follow-up, we will consider restarting the aspirin for stroke prevention once he is further out from his bleeding. Will not likely restart coumadin in the near future. CV - SBP was in 210s at presentation - [**Name (NI) 1094**] son reports high BP prior to admission, but denies any past readings in this range. Management of his BP has been challenging and has required sequential addition of anti-hypertensive meds. He was on atenolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril 40 qd - here, he was given metoprolol 100 tid, captopril 75 [**Hospital1 **] (for low GFR, less frequent dosing), HCTZ 50mg qd, Norvasc 5mg qd with a range between 140 - 150s. His BP should be <140, and would recommend further titration of his meds to achieve that goal for future stroke prevention. ID - Pt was found to have UTI and aspiration PNA although he had been afebrile and wnl WBC. He received a 7 day course of levofloxacin and flagyl followed by a repeat U/A to assess resolution of UTI. He became more alert after the first 2 days of antibiotics and discontinuation of his foley. Pt should be monitored for aspiration pneumonia as he still has difficulty swallowing his secretions and he remains at higher risk of aspiration w/ PEG in place. GI - On upper endoscopy, pt found to have gastritis. Recommended continuing PPI. Resp - Satting well on RA. Pt has coarse upper airway sounds, likely due to inability to swallow secretions. He should continue to receive chest PT and suctioning. FEN - Swallow eval initially difficult due to pt's lethargy; however, noted that he was not able to swallow small ice chip. After failing his swallow eval a third time in the son's presence, family agreed to PEG placement. He completed this procedure w/o complications, and he is tolerating tube feeds at goal of 70cc/hr. He should have another eval in the future when pt's neurologic symptoms show improvement.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with severer global hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-3-19**], left ventricular cavity size is minimally smaller and systolic function is minimally improved. Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis appears more global, but of similar magnitude. CXR [**2199-7-29**]: The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged, accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. Current examination is limited by exclusion of the extreme lung apices. Repeat radiograph to include the entirety of the lungs is recommended. Finally, ICD remains in place with leads overlying right atrium and right ventricle. Brief Hospital Course: 43yo male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] with severe dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy, systolic CHF, LVEF 15%, massively dilated LV, morbid obesity with weight in excess of 415 lbs., s/p BiV/ICD with LBBB, OSA who was directly admitted to CCU for decompensated systolic CHF requiring IV milrinone and lasix for diuresis. . # PUMP/DECOMPENSATED SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: EF 15% during last ECHO in [**3-25**] thought to be nonischemic cardiac myopathy, baseline weight prior to admission 400 pounds on diuretics (torsmide 60 mg [**Hospital1 **]). However, patient was hypotensive with that regimen. Upon admission patient was started on lasix drip up to 30 mg/hr. Patient was very hypotensive and required neosynephrine drip and milrinone with beta-blocker to reduce tachycardia. Patient was diuresing 5-10 L per day and requiring up to 300 meq potassium. Electrolytes were monitored three time daily and as noted potassium was repleted agressively with a goal of 4.5 -5. Patient was also started on Metalazone, Aldactone, and Acetazolamide. Diuresis was continued until patient's creatinine level peaked at 2.4. In total patient was diuresed 56 liters. On discharge patient was transitioned to oral medications including torsemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **], Aldactone 50mg Daily, with Potassium 40meq [**Hospital1 **]. Patient will be followed closely as an outpatient by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**]. # RHYTHM: On admission patient had a V paced/AV paced rhythm (with biV/ICD). During the admission patient was monitored on telemetry for concern of increased ectopy given patient was being treated with milrinone and IV Lasix. Throughout the hospitalization patient had multiple episodes of non sustained ventricular tachycardia. Patient was placed on metoprolol and uptitrated to Toprol XL 300mg Daily at discharge. Of note patient had three episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia which led to ventricular fibrillation and ICD firing after failed anti tachycardic pacing. The first two episodes reguiring ICD firing were in the setting of milrinone. The final episode of v fib reguiring ICD firing occured after milrinone was stopped and was thought to be secondary to changes in intracellular electrolytes mainly potassium and digoxin. Prior to discharge patient went three days without any episodes of non sustained ventricular tachycardia. Patient will be followed as an outpatient by both Electrophysiology and Heart Failure clinics. . # Acute vs Chronic Renal Failure: Patient with unknown recent baseline. Crt on admission was 1.5 and 1.3 in [**2197**]. Most likely secondary to poor cardiac output. Lisinopril was held. Creatinine was followed during the hospitalization and slowly trended up, during the admission it was as high as 2.4 prior to IV lasix being held. At discharge patient crt decreased to 2.1. Renal function will be followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in the outpatient clinic. . # CORONARIES: Patient without history of coronary artery disease. However, no catheterization in the past. Patient was continued on ASA. . # Gout: Patient had an episode of gout during admission involving the left great toe. Given Colchicine which improved pain. Developed diarrhea which resolved when colchicine was stopped. . # OSA: Stable during admission.

Name: [**Known lastname 10283**], [**Known firstname **] Unit No: [**Numeric Identifier 10284**] Service: ADDENDUM: The patient was going to continue having a further oncologic workup for his malignancy which would include a bone scan and a magnetic resonance imaging of the head. The patient had the bone scan performed on [**2169-5-18**]. The magnetic resonance imaging of the head was attempted twice; however, due to the patient's Tourette syndrome, he was moving too much in the magnetic resonance imaging machine to get worthwhile images. The option of intubating him in order to get the magnetic resonance imaging was discussed with the patient and his family; however, they felt this was not something which he would have wanted, so no magnetic resonance imaging will be done, and Oncology is aware of that. In addition, the patient was seen by Psychiatry in order to help restart him on some of his antipsychotics and antidepressants. He was restarted on his Prozac and his Seroquel on Tuesday, [**5-15**], with good affect. The Prozac was started at 20 mg by mouth every day. It should be increased by 20 mg every five days to a goal of 60 mg once per day as tolerated. Lastly, the patient's INR was supratherapeutic on [**5-17**]. His Coumadin was held. He was given one dose of vitamin K. His INR had started to trend down. He should restart his Coumadin when his INR is at 2 to 3, and it will be restarted at 2.5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep. DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: He is being discharged to an extended care facility. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Same. FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Same. RECOMMENDED FOLLOWUP: 1. Follow up with primary care physician within two weeks. 2. Follow up with Neurology (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10285**]) in two weeks. 3.

Service: [**Doctor Last Name **] CHIEF COMPLAINT: Respiratory distress and right-sided weakness. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old male with a history of Tourette's, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, right bundle-branch block, and a history of a myocardial infarction at 34 years of old presenting with shortness of breath and right-sided weakness. The patient originally presented at 1:30 a.m. to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital. There, a head computed tomography was performed which was reportedly normal. A D-dimer was elevated as well as troponin. A chest x-ray was done which was thought to be consistent with a pneumonia. The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further workup of an acute stroke. In the Emergency Department, the patient had a computed tomography angiogram positive for a pulmonary embolus. Head computed tomography was repeated which showed a large apical mass. He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of his pulmonary embolus and acute stroke. According to the patient and his family, he had been feeling generally ill since [**Month (only) 956**] with cough, hemoptysis, congestion, nausea, and vomiting. Over the past three prior to admission he had increased shortness of breath, left calf pain, weakness, lethargy, headache, and neck discomfort. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of Tourette's (with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder). 2. Right bundle-branch block. 3. History of myocardial infarction at the age of 34. 4. History of Bell's palsy. 5. Hyperglycemia. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications at home include atenolol, Seroquel, and Prozac. ALLERGIES: ..................... FAMILY HISTORY: Father with prostate cancer and colon cancer. Mother with scleroderma, congestive heart failure, and history deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (on chronic Coumadin). Daughter with a history of three miscarriages. SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his girlfriend since [**2145**] ([**Name2 (NI) **]) who is also his health care proxy (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 54972**]). He has a 35-year to 40-pack-year smoking history. He quit alcohol use one year ago. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION: Temperature of 100.5, his heart rate was 92, his blood pressure was 122/81, his respiratory rate was 30 to 40, and he was saturating 100% on 3 liters nasal cannula. In general, he was an obese male using his abdominal and accessory muscles for breathing. He was talking in 1-word to 2-word sentences with an expressive aphasia and difficulty word finding. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact. The mucous membranes were dry. There was no lymphadenopathy. Jugular venous pressure could not be assessed. Heart revealed normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds with distant heart sounds. The lungs had bilateral rhonchi. The abdomen was obese, soft, and nontender. There were positive bowel sounds. Extremities had 1+ pitting edema on the left. Neurologic examination revealed 0/5 strength in the right upper extremity and right lower extremity. Strength was [**6-14**] in the left upper extremity and left lower extremity. Normal sensation throughout. Right-sided facial droop. PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION: The patient had a white blood cell count of 14.7 (with 83% neutrophils and 12% lymphocytes), his hematocrit was 39, and his platelets were 133. Chemistries were within normal limits with normal renal function. His INR was 1.4. Initial set of troponins with a creatine kinase of 184, troponin T of 1.05. Liver function tests were within normal limits. Arterial blood gas on mask ventilation showed 7.36/43/133. Repeat arterial blood gas on 4 liters nasal cannula showed 7.35/42/73. His lactate was 0.7 (down from 1.5). PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: Lower extremity Doppler studies showed a deep venous thrombosis in the left popliteal vein. A chest x-ray showed a right apical lung mass with extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with patchy left lower lobe atelectasis and increased interstitial markings diffusely, suggestive of lymphangitic spread. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no atrial septal defect or patent foramen [**Last Name (LF) 43369**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, anterior space fat pad, no wall motion abnormalities. A computed tomography of the head with contrast showed a subacute left frontal lobe infarction. A computed tomography angiogram of the chest showed right lower lobe thrombus in the segmental branch and a 4.4-cm X 4.9-cm mass in the right apex of the lung, positive lymphadenopathy, and patchy opacification in the right upper lobe, with atelectasis in the left lower base, and a fatty liver. A carotid ultrasound showed no stenosis of the bilateral carotids. An x-ray of the orbit showed no metallic foreign bodies. An electrocardiogram with sinus tachycardia at 120, with Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF. There was a intraventricular conduction delay with a right bundle morphology with ST depressions in V3 and T wave inversions in V1. BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM: 1. PULMONARY ISSUES: The patient was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for better monitoring of his respiratory status. He was in acute respiratory distress on admission and was placed on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for a brief period of time. His shortness of breath symptomatically improved, and he required 3 liters by nasal cannula when he was stable. His lungs were rhonchorous bilaterally. He was placed on a heparin drip for his pulmonary embolism as well as his deep venous thrombosis. A computerized axial tomography was also positive for a right upper lobe apical mass which was nonobstructive. This was suspicious for a cancer; either lung cancer or a lymphoma. The Pulmonary Service was consulted, and sputum cytology was sent. There was an increased risk for recurrent pulmonary emboli given the patient's deep venous thrombosis if the patient was to be taken off of his heparin drip for a bronchoscopy. Therefore, a temporary inferior vena cava filter was placed by Interventional Radiology on [**2169-5-9**]. The patient will be taken for a bronchoscopy on [**2169-5-12**] for a biopsy of his right upper lobe apical mass. He will follow up with Hematology/Oncology for the results. The patient's partial thromboplastin time goal for his pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis is between 60 and 80. He will be started on Coumadin and continued on heparin drip status post bronchoscopy until his INR is above 2 for greater than 48 hours, overlapping with heparin. The patient was treated empirically for a postobstructive pneumonia as the patient was febrile on admission. He was given levofloxacin and Flagyl for a 7-day course. All sputum cultures grew moderate oropharyngeal flora. 2. NEUROLOGIC ISSUES: The patient sustained two ischemic events causing a right-sided paresis as well as a Broca aphasia. His speech continued to improve during his hospital course with speech therapy. He also received physical therapy and occupational therapy. A repeat head computed tomography showed normal evolution of his two ischemic strokes in the left frontal parasagittal area as well as the left occipital temporal area. There was no sign of hemorrhagic transformation. A transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study was performed to assess for intracardiac shunt, and was negative for atrial septal defect or patent foramen [**Year (4 digits) 43369**]. Carotid ultrasounds were also performed to look for an embolic source of his strokes and were negative for stenoses. A magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography could not be performed during this hospital stay secondary to the patient's agitation and inability to lay still for a long period of time. The patient was to follow up with Neurology as an outpatient by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12544**]. 3. CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES: The patient had evidence of demand ischemia with a peak creatine kinase of 184, MB of 20, and troponin T of 1.04. Electrocardiogram showed old evidence of ischemia in the inferior leads. His enzymes continued to trend down. The patient was placed on a heparin drip, aspirin, beta blocker, and statin on admission. His aspirin had to be held prior to bronchoscopy and was to be restarted after this procedure. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater than 25% with no wall motion abnormalities. No further anticoagulation for cardiac ischemia was given secondary to his new cerebrovascular accident and an increased risk of bleed. Cardiology was consulted and recommended medical management with a high-dose statin, aspirin, and beta blocker. An ACE inhibitor should be added as an outpatient. His systolic blood pressure was kept between 140 to 160 while in house to maintain perfusion to the brain, and this should be continued for two weeks after his event. The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37053**] where his beta blocker should be titrated up and an outpatient stress test will be considered. 4. HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES: The patient likely has a hypercoagulable state from possible cancer as well as likely a genetic predisposition to form clots. He has a history of hypercoagulability in his mother, and his daughter has a history of multiple miscarriages. The family was counseled and recommended to have genetic testing done. The patient was to follow up with Hematology/Oncology to have outpatient hypercoagulability studies as well as to have follow up with his sputum cytology +/- lung biopsy. The patient's hematocrit remained stable while in house. He had an anemia consistent with a chronic disease anemia with a normal B12, folate, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. 5. HYPERGLYCEMIA ISSUES: The patient was maintained on a diabetic/low-cholesterol diet. His fingerstick blood glucoses were measured four times per day, and he was placed on an insulin sliding-scale. His blood sugars remained in the middle 100 range. 6. GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES: The patient complained of nausea for several days after he was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit. His liver function tests were within normal limits as well as his amylase and lipase. A computed tomography of the chest showed that there was a fatty liver, and this should be followed up as an outpatient. His nausea continued to improve and may have been secondary to his antibiotics. CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Good. DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: Discharged to acute rehabilitation. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP: 1. The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37053**] with Cardiology as an outpatient. 2. The patient was to follow up with Neurology (with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12544**]). 3.

On hospital day four ([**6-4**]) he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4, LV Aneurysm repair and thrombectomy. Please see operative report for surgical details. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable but serious condition on multiple Inotropes/Pressors. On post-op day one his balloon pump was removed. From post-op day two to three he had multiple runs of VT that required defibrillation. EP service was consulted. He continued to remain on multiple pressors and was sedated/intubated over the next several days. He continued to have an elevated WBC and fever with a CXR ultimately showing a possible pneumonia. Antibiotics were started and he was seen by Infectious disease who recommnended a 10 day course of vancomycin and zosyn for a tracheal aspirate positive for MSSA and coag negative staph in one blood culture bottle. He was extubated and weaned from his vasoactive drips on POD # 9. He remained in the ICU awaiting VT ablation and ICD placement. On POD #15 he had an ICD implanted, and he was subsequently transferred to the floor. He was ready for discharge to home on POD #19.

He arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and was still unresponsive with FS 69. He developed seizure activity and was given a second amp of d50 in addition to Ativan 2 mg iv which successfully broke his sz. He found to be drowsy but arousable and oriented x3. . Upon arrival to the floor the patient was again found to be unresponsive and developed a second episode of seizure. He was given Ativan 1 mg IV with resolution of sz. However, that time, the patient's cardiac enzymes returned with a CK of 296 MB 6 Trop 0.37. An EKG revealed new TWI in V5-6. The Cardiology fellow felt this was likely due to demand ischemia precipitated by seizure and hypertension. The patient was then transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. . On arrival to the MICU the patient is somnolent but easily arousable. He was stabilized overnight with q1 hr fsg checks and D5NS @75/hr. The patient accepted ASA prophylaxis but refused Heparin gtt and transfusion. The risks of going without these therapies in the setting of ACS were carefully explained to the patient who opted to go without those therapies. . The following day the patient was stable and transferred to the floor without event for a brief observation period prior to discharge. [**Last Name (un) **], Rheum, and Heme-Onc consultants all visited with Mr. [**Known lastname **] to discuss the possibility of starting Rituximab vs. Prednisone therapy to treat his autoimmune antibody syndrome.

She was last admitted from [**Date range (1) **] with acute on chronic renal failure and new CHF with new systolic and diastolic dysfunction and was started on diuretics. . On discussion with staff at the [**Hospital3 2558**], the pt. was in her USOH until this AM when she was noted to be more lethargic than usual and demonstrated oxygen saturation of 62% on 3L NC. She wears 3L O2 at baseline. She has been afebrile. No cough. Baseline, can answer questions and is on oxygen per nursing. Per [**Hospital3 **] RN, her lasix dose was decreased on [**3-14**] from 120 mg po qd to 80 mg po qd. . Per ED signout, she presented there initially hypoxic and with a right gaze preference, not initially moving her LUE, and a decreased gag reflex. She was intubated for airway protection secondary to her decreased gag and she had a head CT that showed no acute hemorrhage but an equivocal new hypodense focus in right parietal white matter. Urine tox screen was negative and labs showed worsening renal failure from 3.9-->4.6. She was given vancomycin/levofloxacin/clindamycin for a questionable PNA? She was also given narcan and lidocaine for unclear reasons. . She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further evaluation. Here, she was intubated and sedated. No further history could be obtained. . Past Medical History: 1. Hypertension. 2. Diabetes mellitus. 3. Paranoid schizophrenia. 4. History of frequent falls. 5. Hypercholesterolemia. 6. Iron deficiency anemia. 7. Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2149**]. 8. History of granulomatous hepatitis in [**2139**]. 9.

HEAD CT- No acute hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. Equivocal new hypodense focus in right parietal white matter. MRI with diffusion weighted images is more sensitive in evaluation of acute ischemia/infarct and for vascular detail. . CXR #1 - R. mainstem bronchus intubation, cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, diffuse opacity of left lung, NG tube in stomach . CXR #2 - CHF. Cannot clearly see an infiltrate on this CXR. Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 75 yo F with HTN, DM, CVA, CRI who presents from her NH with hypoxia and unresponsive and intubated in the ED for airway protection. . 1. Hypoxia- Most likely etiology of this hypoxia is CHF exacerbation given the CXR and BNP >70,000. Also considered in the differential was a pneumonia and she was covered with vanco/levaquin. However, she remained afebrile and with flat wbc count so these were eventually discontinued. She received diuretics that initially included a lasix gtt. Howerver, she failed to diurese well to this and it was expanded to include diuril. She responded with moderate diuresis to this regimen. A family meeting was held with the sister [**1-13**] her recent decline in functional capacity and the decision was made to extubate the patient and change her code status to DNR/DNI. She tolerated the extubation w/out event and was maintained on a high flow mask with SpO2 in the 90s. Her CHF regimen was maximized with hydralazine and imdur although an ACE-I was avoided [**1-13**] her ARF. . 2. AMS: The patient was unresponsive with decreased gag reflex and left UE paralysis initially. Neurology evaluated the patient and a CT scan showed a new hypodensity. Neurology felt that this could be responsible for her AMS but that it was likely not an acute event and had happened in the recent past. After extubation, her mental status continued to be depressed despite adequate treatment of her CHF and infectious processes. . 3. Acute on chronic renal failure - This was attributed to both her UTI and her increased lasix dose. Her FeUrea >30 which did not suggest a prerenal etiology. She was treated for her proteus UTI with ceftriaxone and continued to be diuresed as above. Her creatinine initially trended towards normal but rose again just prior to discharge likely due to more aggressive diuresis in the setting of her active CHF. . 4. UTI - Treated with with ciprofloxacin initially but this was changed to CTX once culture sensitivities became available. . 4. HTN - Her BP was treated w/ hydral/imdur as above. . 5. DM - She was followed with finger sticks and covered with an ISS. . 6. Code status - As mentioned previously, the patient was initially full code and was intubated for respiratory protection. Discussion with her sister (and HCP) led to her being extubated and her code status being changed to DNR/DNI. At the time of discharge, the current plan of care was to make her comfortable and continue to treat her underlying CHF/UTI with oral meds if the patient was able to take them. The HCP wished to avoid any procedures that would cause her pain such as central line placement, NGT placement, or the initiation of pressors. Medications on Admission: 1. Hydralazine 75 mg po q6h 2.

At baseline he is able to ambulate approximately [**Age over 90 **] yards before getting fatigued, however over the past day he has been increasingly short of breath with minimal exertion and yesterday morning was short of breath at rest. He also reports one to two minutes of substernal chest pressure this afternoon which resolved spontaneously - notes that this was very different from CP in [**Month (only) 547**]. No radiation or associated diaphoresis or nausea. In [**Month (only) 547**] he describes more intense chest pressure with left arm numbness and vomiting. Of note, he recently travelled to Foxwoods and noted that he did not take his medications for 2 days (Sunday/Monday) and had many dietary indiscretions including all-you-can-eat buffets. He did do his PD manually which is how he normally does PD when he travels (at home uses a machine). . In the ED, the patient's vitals were T 100.0, BP 133/72, HR 94, RR 28, O2sat 87% on RA, 97% on 6L. Labs notable for elevated white count at 12.5 and 90% neutrophils, troponin T 1.36, CK 173, CKMB 20, MB index 11.6. Blood cultures were sent. He was given Levofloxacin for possible PNA and Lasix 80mg IV. CXR read as likely pulmonary edema, consider atypical infection. ECG unchanged, first degree AV block. He was given aspirin, beta blocker. Cards consult in ED felt that elevated troponins were related to demand ischemia with CHF exacerbation in setting of dietary indiscretion and medication non-compliance. . Review of systems on admission is positive for orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, PND, LE edema and occasional chest pain. He also notes dysuria but is unsure if discomfort with urination began prior to or following placemtn of the urinary catheter. Negative for fevers, chills. Past Medical History: - renal cell carcinoma s/p R nephrectomy [**2103**] - ESRD after failing of L kidney, now on peritoneal dialysis, undergoing renal transplant eval - HTN - chronic hep C: found during kidney transplant eval, currently being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in liver clinic and was being evaluated for cirrhoisis with liver bx on [**9-12**] - CAD s/p MI in [**5-4**], bare metal stent to RCA - hemorrhoids: s/p surgical correction [**8-3**], with subsequent decrease in BRBPR but still gets on occasion.

There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-4-29**], the findings are similar. . [**2109-10-5**] Echo: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal mid to distal septal hypokinesis (branch disease?). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly to moderately thickened. There is a moderate-sized, mobile echodensity on the aortic valve (0.7 cm mobile echodensity on the LV side of the non-coronary cusp) suggestive of a vegetation. There is no significant valvular aortic stenosis (at most trivial). The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate to severe mitral annular calcification (involving the chordal structures). There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. . Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-10-4**], no change (aortic valve vegetation was present but not reported. Mild regional LV hypokinesis was present but not reported). Reviewing the TTE from [**5-4**], the regional dysfunction and aortic vegetation are now new. IMPRESSION: Mild regional LV hypokinesis (overall preserved LVEF of 55%) c/w CAD. Moderate-sized aortic valve vegetation of unclear significance. Moderate AI. If clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess the valvular vegetation. [**2109-10-8**] TEE: Conclusions: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a moderate-sized (0.8 mm x 0.5 mm) vegetation on the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed with focal areas of increased thickening. A possible vegetation is noted on the posterior mitral valve leaflet. No mitral valve abscess is seen. There is severe mitral annular calcification without overt mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no abscess of the tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Vegetation on the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve with moderate aortic regurgitation. Possible vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mild mitral regurgitation. Complex atheroma is in the descending aorta. No definite perivalvular abcess. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 8014**] is a 58 year old male with multiple medical problems including ESRD on PD who presents with one day of cough, shortness of breath due concerning for acute coronary syndrome, transferred to the MICU and found to have aortic valve vegetation on TTE as an incidental finding. . MICU Course: He was admitted to the MICU for further care of his shortness of breath and positive cardiac enzymes. The troponin levels remained elevated due to poor renal clearance, whereas CK-MB trended down and was no longer tracked on transfer from MICU. Cardiology followed the patient closely and decided not to puruse cath options since the patient is not an anticoagulation candidate due to history of GI bleeds. Cardiology felt that ischemia was due to demand in the setting of decompensated CHF. He had transient episodes of RVR secondary afib, with beta blockade held once during a transient episode of hypotension on [**10-8**] (MICU day 6). Otherwise, the patient was hemodynamically stable for most of his MICU course. . The patient was also transiently short of breath, with O2 saturations in the low 90s while on 4LNC. His respiratory status improved with nebulizers and fluid-balance control with his peritoneal dialysis. On transfer from the MICU, he saturated well on room air. Of note, a TTE ([**2109-10-5**]) was revealing of an aortic valve vegetation that was not present as seen in an echo from [**2109-4-29**]. A subsequent TEE confirmed the aortic vegetation, and revealed a possible mitral valvle abnormality. Of note, no abscesses were found. All blood cultures have been negative to date. A presumptive diagnosis of culture-negative endocarditis was made on [**10-8**]. Broad antibiotic coverage was started with IV vancomycin and levofloxacin. A PICC line was placed on [**10-9**] to allow proper IV access for treatment. On transfer to the medicine service, he did not complain of new chest pains or shortness of breath. He continued to get peritoneal dialysis throughout his MICU stay. His MICU LOS was 7 days. *** . # Cardiac: **Ischemia: On this admission, cardiac enzymes were positive in the ED and likely due to demand ischemia. An EKG showed 1st degree AV block, nondiagnostic Q waves in inferior and lateral leads, and 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions in V4-V6. Troponin continued to remain elevated likely due to poor clearance and less likely related to ongoing ischemia. The CK-MB was flat. Anticoagulation was held due to his history of GI bleeding. He was maintained on beta-blockers, and aspirin. Upon transfer from the MICU to the medicine floor, he was hemodynamically stable. On two occasions he complained of chest discomfort that was responsive to a GI cocktail. On discharge, he no longer had angina or dyspnea. **Pump: He had an ejection fraction of 55% on TTE. He was kept on bete blockers and kept euvolemic for his stay. He had mild bilateral edema to his ankles that diminished by the day of discharge. **Rhythm: In the MICU, he had transient episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. On transfer to the medicine floor, he remained in normal sinus rhythm while being monitored on telemetry. He did have a borderline prolonged QT interval of 450 that was closely monitored on serial EKGs in the setting of levofloxacin which is known to prolong QT intervals. . # Aortic valve vegetation: He was treated for culture-negative endocarditis. On admission, the patient had a low grade temperature, and elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance. There were no clear sources of infection, and urine, blood cultures, and chest x-ray were all negative. However, the presentation was concerning for endocarditis based on vegetation on his aortic valve (with a possible vegetation on the mitral valve as well) on TEE imaging. He also had an elevated ESR, and CRP. Gentamicin was not started due to poor renal function and concerns for eigth cranial nerve damage. He was continued on levofloxacin (PO) and IV vancomycin. Morning trough levels were used to find an optimal dosing regimen (500 mg every 72 hours). He should continue to complete a 6 week course of levofloxacin and vancomycin. A PICC was inserted to allow a visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5050**] vancomycin as needed. By the day of discharge, all cultures and seroligies were negative or pending. . # Hypoxia: On admission he was oxygenating well on 5L NC, however he became tachypneic in the MICU, and he was tried on CPAP with some improvement. His chest x-ray on admission showed volume overload with no signs of infiltrate. Peritoneal dialysis was initiated at higher concentration to remove fluid. On transfer to the medicine floor, he oxygenated well on room air and was given atrovent and albuterol nebulizers as needed. . # ESRD on PD/RCC s/p nephrectomy: He was followed by the renal team throughout his hospitalization. He was given a dose of lasix 40mg IV x 2 in ED, and responded with only minimal urinary output. He was continued with PD - 1.5%, 1.5% and 2.5% every 6 hours. His phosphate levels continued to be elevated and he was started on PhosLo with good effect. Medications were renally dosed. He was given an outpatient appointment to be followed by a nephrologist here as well as nutritionist from the transplant center. Erythropoetin was restarted prior to discharge but no change in hematcrit was observed. . # Chronic LGIB: He has a history of Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids, and a capsule endoscopy from [**2109-8-27**] showed fresh blood in the duodenum. An EGD showed gastric antral vascular ectasia s/p APC coag on [**9-5**]. During this hospitalization, his hematocrit was stable at 26-28. Anticoagulants were held. .

Even though glimepiride is hepatically metabolized, the metabolites are renally cleared (~60%) so it seems most likely that her recent acute renal failure precipitated impaired clearance of her sulfonylurea leading to hypoglycemia. The patient's glimiperide was stopped, and she was restarted on Metformin 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] prior to discharge. The patient's glucose remained between 100 and 200 for the remainder of her hospital course. The patient will follow up with her PCP regarding this issue, and she should continue to avoid Glimiperide in the future. . # Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 4.1 on admission, which is increased from her baseline of 1.0. Her urine volume and electrolytes were most consistent with pre-renal etiology. Her creatinine decreased from 4.1 to 1.3 with IVFs. Nephrology recommended holding her home dose of Lasix and initially holding her Lisinopril. Her Lisinopril was restarted prior to discharge, and it is recommended that she continue to hold her Lasix until her follow up appointment with her PCP. . # Word-finding/falls: The patient was found to have word-finding difficulties and multiple falls prior to admission. Neurology was consulted, and it was thought that the patient's AMS was most likely [**1-19**] metabolic encephalopathy (hypoglycemia, supra-therapeutic tri-cyclic levels, acute renal failure, multiple opiates). These metabolic abnormalities were corrected during this hospitalization, and her mental status improved to her baseline. . # Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia without evidence of acute or chronic blood loss. Iron studies were checked on this admission, which were consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Her Hct remained stable on this admission and she did not have any acute events. . # Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain, related to musculo-skeletal history (cervical fusion, osteoarthritis, etc). The patient was using Fentanyl pops at home. Given the fact that this medication is not on formulary, the patient was continued on Dilaudid prn. Her pain remained well control with this regimen, and she was discharged on Fentanyl pops. . # OSA: The patient was found to have OSA while in the MICU. She was started on CPAP during her stay. She was unable to tolerate the CPAP after her MICU stay, and it is recommended that the patient have a formal sleep study upon discharge. Case management determined that her insurance will cover this study at [**Hospital 3278**] Hospital, and she should follow up with her PCP regarding this issue.

Discharge Disposition: Home Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Hypoglycemia Acute renal failure Secondary: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Discharge Condition: Good. The patient's VS are normal, and his blood sugars are now > 100. Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had altered mental status in the setting of hypoglycemia. While you were here, you were found to have acute renal failure. We believe that you fist developed acute renal failure from drinking too little over the past two days, and this unfortunately made your Glimiperide more active. We took you off of this medication and gave you plenty of IV fluids. Your kidney function has returned to [**Location 213**], and we restarted you on Metforming 1000 mg twice daily. While you were here, we made the following changes to your medications: 1. We STOPPED your Lasix on this admission. Please check with your PCP before restarting this medication 2. We STOPPED your Glimiperide 3. We DECREASED you Tizanidine to 4 mg three times daily. Please take all medications as prescribed. Please keep all previously scheduled appointments. Please return to the ED or your healthcare provider if you experience increased confusion, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms. Please check your blood sugar twice daily until you see your PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**]. Please drink [**Location (un) 2452**] juice if you notice that your sugars are < 60.

Service: SURGERY Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ciprofloxacin Attending:[**Known firstname 148**] Chief Complaint: 1. Retroperitoneal sepsis. 2. Duodenal cutaneous fistula. 3. Biliary obstruction. 4. Extensive adhesions of intraabdominal contents. Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. Exploratory laparotomy. 2. Extended adhesiolysis. 3. Duodenal cutaneous fistula takedown with primary closure of the duodenum. 4. Choledochojejunostomy (Roux-en-Y). 5. Gastroenterostomy. 6. J-tube placement. 7. Drainage of retroperitoneal sepsis. 8. Small-bowel resection. History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 74-year-old gentleman who has suffered a difficult problem over the last 6 to 8 months. He originally had a peptic ulcer which was treated by embolization techniques of the gastroduodenal artery. In the process of this, the pancreatic head was necrosed. This led to a retroperitoneal sepsis which I had ultimately took care of. He required a retroperitoneal exploration and drainage originally. At that time, the head of the pancreas and duodenum were found to be necrotic from this process. He subsequently recovered from this, but over the last 6 months suffered from recurrent bouts of intraabdominal and retroperitoneal sepsis. These have been treated by percutaneous tube decompressions. However, on each occasion the sepsis has recurred. Accordingly, a fistulogram was obtained in the last month and this indeed showed communication of this retroperitoneal right upper quadrant abscess collection with the duodenum. Based on this, we knew that the source of this festering infection was in fact his duodenum. A CAT scan was obtained and this suggested a lateral tenting of the duodenum into the retroperitoneum consistent with a fistula tract. Furthermore, he had developed significant biliary dilation over this time with the bile duct over 1.5 cm in diameter. This had contrast within it and there was pneumoperitoneum indicated that there was connection perhaps with the GI tract. Nonetheless, it was significantly dilated indicative of downstream obstruction. This would not be surprising given the fact that the head of his pancreas literally was necrotic where I first encountered him. After shepherding Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] through many months of rehabilitation and increase improving nutritional status, I posed to him that he is now suitably ready for definitive operation to address this persistent infectious problem. [**Name (NI) **] at this point had no forward progress being made because of this. We continued to support him through an enteral feedings through a J tube because his appetite was poor. I had many long and detailed discussions with Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] and his wife and daughter about this dilemma and the need for definitive surgical intervention on this area. I described to him the fact that I had hoped that this could be a limited excision of the fistulous tract and bypass the biliary system. On the other hand, I prepared him for a Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy should there be evidence that the whole duodenum and pancreatic head was destroyed by this process and involved with the fistulous retroperitoneal sepsis. We discussed the risks and benefits of this operation, and his risks included poor wound healing, bleeding and infection as well as the significant chance of leaks or breakdowns in any of the connection. We also talked about the other traditional risks of major abdominal surgery including heart attack, stroke, pulmonary and renal failure as well as cardiac problems. I did quote him a significant chance of death from this operation on the terms of [**2-16**]%. He and his wife understood these risks and he wished to proceed. We went to the operating room on the morning of [**2201-1-21**] with the intent of forming a duodenal cutaneous fistulas takedown and debridement and drainage of retroperitoneal sepsis as well as a biliary bypass.

Imaging: MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2183-10-28**] 9:43 PM IMPRESSION: 1. Very limited study due to motion artifact. A complete diagnostic examination was not performed. 2. Collapse of the L1 vertebral body with retropulsion of bony fragments into the canal, with probable severe cord compression. 3. Left-sided paraspinal mass, and mass in the left renal fossa. These findings are not well evaluated here. . CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST [**2183-10-29**] 12:57 PM IMPRESSION: 1. Hyperdense focus in the left basal ganglia, with enhancement. Lack of mass effect and edema is more suggestive of a cavernoma than a metastasis, but an MRI is recommended in order to evaluate further and to better characterize the lesion. Alternatively, if prior outside imaging can be obtained to show long-term stability, demonstration of benignity could be achieved without further imaging. 2. Surgical clip along the posterior aspect of the left maxillary sinus, possibly due to prior surgical treatment for hemorrhage. Correlation with surgical history is recommended. . ECHO Study Date of [**2183-10-30**] Conclusions: 1. A large (4x6.5 cm), mobile mass with a large cyst is seen in the right atrium, probably starting in the IVC, filling almost all of the right atrrium, prolapsing through the tricuspid valve, and into the right ventricle. 2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 3. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. . MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST [**2183-10-31**] 3:21 PM IMPRESSION: Small focus of chronic blood products and enhancement in the left subinsular region adjacent to the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle as described above. The differential diagnosis is between cavernous angioma and a metastatic disease given the patient's clinical history of a renal cell cancer. The MRI appearances and the presence of developmental venous anomaly in the adjacent brain favor cavernous malformation as suggested on the previous CT. However, if further assessment is clinically indicated, the perfusion MRI with arterial spin labeling may help for differentiation MRA OF THE HEAD: The head MRA is limited by motion. No evidence of vascular occlusion or high-grade stenosis is seen in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation. IMPRESSION: Motion limited head MRA demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion. . CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST [**2183-10-31**] 10:38 AM IMPRESSION: 1. Very large left renal mass with multiple associated bulky retroperitoneal, adrenal, and left paraspinal metastases. This is again most consistent with renal cell carcinoma. 2. Destruction of the L1 vertebral body with associated epidural disease compressing the spinal canal superiorly at this level. 3. Extensive tumor thrombus within the inferior vena cava extending into the right atrium and crossing the tricuspid valve. 4. Evidence of pulmonary metastases with largest mass demonstrated in the right middle lobe. 5. Bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and anasarca. 6. Technically successful fine needle aspiration and core biopsy of large left renal mass. . CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2183-11-1**] 12:13 PM IMPRESSION: 1. Mild spondylytic changes, without evidence of osseous metastatic disease in the cervical spine. . CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2183-11-1**] 12:12 PM IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique compared to the prior MR, similar appearance of compression fracture of L1 with associated enhancing soft tissue mass. There is probably similar severe canal stenosis as well as involvement of the left-sided neural foramina at T12-L1 and L1-L2. . CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2183-11-1**] 12:12 PM IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique compared to the prior MR, similar appearance of compression fracture of L1 with associated enhancing soft tissue mass. There is probably similar severe canal stenosis as well as involvement of the left-sided neural foramina at T12-L1 and L1-L2. . MRA LUMBAR SPINE [**2183-11-3**] 10:37 AM IMPRESSION: Anterior spinal artery is not definitively visualized. L1 compression fracture and mass consistent with the patient's known osseous metastasis. . XRAY L SPINE [**2183-11-9**] Standing L-Spine; Hardware intact, no shift Brief Hospital Course: 60 YO F with newly diagnosed metastatic renal CA and pathologic with L1 compression fx and pain control.

L1 compression fracture: - Patient had embolization procedure on [**2183-11-4**] - Neurosurgery performed L1 vertebrectomy with T10 to L3 thoracolumbar fusion/instrumentation and tumor resection on [**2183-11-5**]. She tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to PACU post op and remained intubated overnight. On POD#1 she was extubated. She had good LE strength. She was started on PCA. Hct was followed and she did need transfusion post op. She was transferred to the floor on POD#2. Her diet and activity were advanced. PCA was transitioned to po pain med. PT evaluated pt and found her appropriate for rehab. Incision was clean dry and well healing. - On IV decadron. Patient's neuro exam has improved slightly while on steroids. - Rad Onc has seen patient and suggest that if this fracture is tumor related, then she would benefit from post-operative radiation. Outside imaging reports have been obtained. She has an old cavernous hemangioma that has been followed and is stable. Finding on CT head from [**2183-10-29**] is likely an old finding. - TLSO brace: Patient has been fitted and will require brace when OOB or greater than 30 degrees in bed. - Continue oxycontin 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] for pain. - Morphine for breakthrough pain. . 2.

Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8684**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None. History of Present Illness: The patient is a 68 year old female with a PMHx significant for asthma/COPD, rectal carcinoma, diet-controlled DMII, HTN, and HL who presents with "cold" like symptoms for the past 3 days and shortness of breath. The patient starting feeling generalized malaise and mylagias on Monday and developed a productive cough with yellow sputum. She reportedly had a temperature at home, exact measurement unknown. She also complained of crampy abdominal pain and vomited non-bloody emesis x 3. She has no known sick contacts and did not receive the flu shot this year. She saw her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] this morning who found her to have a low O2 sat of 85% on room air and she was quickly referred to the ED. In the ED, the patient was found to have diffuse wheezes on exam and she was given Combivent neb treatments x2, albuterol nebs x 2 as well as solumederol. As per the patient's history of asthma, her peak flow at home at baseline is 300. She does not use home O2 and has never been intubated but was hospitalized once one year ago for an asthma exacerbation. She uses her atrovent four times a day and advair daily. Her last exacerbation was in [**Month (only) **] at which time she received steroids and responded well.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: The patient is a 68 year old female with a history of DMII, HTN, HL, and asthma who presents with viral-like syndrome of myalgias, fevers, cough and N/V x 3 days. 1. Fevers - The patient presented with a leukocytosis, fever, cough, N/V, mylagias with a history of DMII and asthma and no prior flu shot. She was placed on droplet precautions and we started amantadine on the day of admission. Her DFA was positive for influenza A although her viral culture was negative. - Her CXR showed a right lower lobe opacity which the radiologist believed might be secondary to atelectasis. However, we believed the patient may also have had a community-acquired pneumonia especially in setting of leukocytosis with left shift. As a result, she was started on Levoquin 500 mg PO Q24 empirically for CAP x 7 day total. 2. Asthma/COPD exacerbation - The patient received salumederol in ER. We started her on 60 mg prednisone for a COPD exacerbation with a slow taper. She was discharged on 30 mg and was told to continue this for 2 more days and then decrease her dose to 10 mg for 3 days and then discontinue the prednisone. - The patient was discharged on 3 L O2, sat'ing 96% but in the high 80s on room air. It was felt that the patient would require home oxygen for approximately one week and then would follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 week to reassess her home O2 needs. - She was continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments. 3. DMII - The patient's blood sugar was in the high 100s, at times 200. She is diet-controlled as an outpatient but was originally unaware, she claims, on admission that she was in fact diabetic and had been eating McDonald's in the hospital. She was placed on a sliding scale and should be followed as an outpatient. 4. HTN - Hypertensive in the ED. Her Captopril was increased to 50 mg. 5. CHF, EF 70-80% - Has diastolic dysfunction. Appeared dry on exam initially. Stable during her admission. 6. Hyperlipidemia - She was continued on Lipitor 20 mg, we added ASA. 7.

Service: C-MEDICINE CHIEF COMPLAINT: Dyspnea. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 73 year old African American male diagnosed with congestive heart failure in [**11-9**], who presents with sudden fatigue, weakness and dyspnea while bringing out his trash. The patient felt well until the morning of admission and was brought to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department by ambulance. In the Emergency Department, the patient was asymptomatic and denied previous oxygen requirement or lower extremity edema. He has been compliant with his congestive heart failure medication including low sodium diet and daily weights. He states that he is without symptoms at this time. In the Emergency Department, he was noted to have atrial flutter with heart rate 120 to 130 with mild hypotension. Due to his abrupt symptoms, the patient underwent VQ scan which indicated low probability for pulmonary embolus. Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, upper respiratory infection symptoms, chest pain, positive for shortness of breath, negative for nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or abdominal pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Congestive heart failure diagnosed in [**11-9**]. Catheterization at that time was negative except for apical and septal akinesis, ejection fraction noted to be 12%. 2. Hypertension. 3. Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled. 4. Prostate cancer, status post prostatectomy. 5. ? multiple myeloma. 6. Hernia, status post herniorrhaphy. 7. Keloid scars. 8. Status post bilateral total knee replacement. 9. Carpal tunnel syndrome. 10. Prolapsed rectum. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Univasc 15 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. 4. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. 5. Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of alcohol use. He also has a history of tobacco use approximately one pack per day for thirty-five to forty years, but quit twenty years ago. FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died of myocardial infarction at age 80. Brother died of diabetes mellitus in his 30s and sister died of diabetes mellitus/systemic lupus erythematosus in her 50s. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs revealed temperature of 96.5, blood pressure 122/70, pulse 113, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 97% on three liters, weight 74.5 kilograms. In general, this is a moderately obese African American male lying in bed in no acute distress. Extraocular movements are intact. Anicteric sclera. Mucous membranes are moist. No lymphadenopathy. No jugular venous distention. Cardiovascular - the heart rate was fast but regular, no murmurs, rubs or gallops. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen revealed normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no masses. Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no swelling, good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count was 10.1, hematocrit 38, platelets 276,000. Prothrombin time 14.2, partial thromboplastin time 28.0, INR 1.4. Chem7 showed a sodium of 140, potassium 4.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 46, creatinine 1.9, blood sugar 175, calcium 9.5. Electrocardiogram showed normal axis, wide QRS with possible Q waves in V1 through V3 with poor R wave progression. There is right bundle branch block. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular - atrial flutter - The patient was started on Heparin in the Emergency Department and underwent transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2177-3-31**], which showed the following: dilated left atrium with no spontaneous echocardiographic contrast seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage with markedly reduced left atrial appendage emptying. There were two mobile echogenic masses seen in the left atrial appendage on multiple views consistent with probable thrombus. There was also severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with right ventricular systolic function appearing depressed. There are small echogenic masses on the ventricular surface of the aortic valve. Mitral regurgitation 1+ was seen. At that time, direct cardioversion was held secondary to the possibility of emboli/clot. That night, the patient was noted to have hypotension to the 70s to 80s which was moderately responsive to intravenous fluids. It was thought secondary to poor atrial kick and decompensation of the heart. The following morning the patient underwent atrial flutter ablation with mild improvement of systolic blood pressure to 90s. The patient continued to have poor response to intravenous fluids with poor urine output. Creatinine was noted to be increased from 2.1 on [**2177-4-1**], to 2.5 on [**2177-4-2**]. At that time, he was transferred to the CCU for intravenous Dopamine for improvement of pressure and diuresed with Lasix drip. Right IJ and right arterial line were introduced at that time. Pulmonary artery catheter was introduced as well noting introductory pressures of the following: right atrial pressure 16 with pulmonary artery pressure of 47/32 with a wedge of 32, cardiac index 2.21 and SVR 1200. He was started on Dopamine with approximate 6.3 liters diuresis after Lasix drip. Wedge decreased to 22 to 23 with cardiac output increased to 6.0 and cardiac index improved to 2.5. The patient was gradually weaned off Lasix drip and placed on p.o. Lasix b.i.d. Dopamine was weaned off on [**2177-4-3**]. On [**2177-4-4**], the patient was transferred back to the floor for further management. That night, Carvedilol was restarted with good effect. 2. Renal - The patient was noted to have times of prerenal, acute renal failure on [**2177-3-31**], at admission with blood urea nitrogen and creatinine both increased. He was given mild intravenous fluids with worsening of creatinine the following day. On [**2177-4-2**], creatinine was noted to be 2.5 with potassium 5.4. He was given Kayexalate to improve his hyperkalemia. Urine electrolytes noted prerenal defect with FENA of 0.21%. At that time, he was transferred to the CCU for Lasix drip and severe diuresis. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were noted to be improved. Creatinine on [**2177-4-4**], was noted to be 1.4 which is almost back to baseline. 3. Hematology - The patient was noted to have hematocrit of 38.0 on admission which has decreased after every procedure. Hematocrit on [**2177-4-4**], was noted to be 28.5. Analysis and iron study laboratories were sent off. Heparin and Coumadin were continued for left atrial thrombus and to prevent embolization.

Patient notes 2 week history of diarrhea assoicated with cramps. No f/c/ns. No hematochezia or melena. Patient also notes 2 to 3 days of weakness. There was no focal numbness or weakness, described as more generalized weakness involving her legs. She started on 14 day course of antibiotics during her last admission for aspiration pneumonia, initially levofloxacin and clindamycin then changed to azithromycin/clindamycin on discharge. Last dose of antibiotics was scheduled for [**2144-4-25**]. The patient was also started on a 7 day course of levofloxacin for a UTI initiated on [**2144-4-20**]. The patient had a stool sample taken [**5-13**] that was positive for C.difficile and her pcp referred her into the emergency department for persistent diarrhea. The patient had taken one Immodium and one dose of metronidazole last evening. On ROS she denies orthopnea or PND. She has increased lower extremity edema since her rehab. The Pts 2 daughters notes increased salt and sugar in her diet at rehab as she was not on restrictions. She also noted no cough, shortness of breath. She admits to increased irritation with urination but no dysuria or hematuria. In the ED she was febrile with a temperature of 102.3F, HR 87, BP 94/47, RR 18, and O2 sat of 95% (supplemental oxygen not recorded). BCX's were taken. A CXR demonstrated increased interstitial opacities of the right lung with bilateral pleural effusions felt consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema. She received 2 liters of normal saline.

Infectious Diarrhea. Positive culture for C.diff as outpatient (s/p treatment with clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia), now down to one stool since yesterday afternoon. WBC 32K with a bandemia. She did take one dose of immodium last night (night prior to admission), no further doses of medications that will decrease gut motility. Followup on KUB that was taken in the ED to evaluate for megacolon; this showed some thickening of the colon. She was initially started on PO flagyl, and her WBC count increased to 40,000 on this therapy. She was switched to IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. CT scan of the abdomen was obtained which showed thickening throughout the colon with some stranding, but no abscess, toxic megacolon, or perforation. Her WBC remained elevated, and she continued to have copious amounts of liquidy stool. She was transferred to the ICU on [**5-18**] for closer monitoring given her lack of clinical improvement. In the ICU, fluid resuscitation was continued (4L); central line was inserted with CVP's slightly elevated at 14. Pressors were then tried (initially levophed and then vasopressin) without effect. The family decided that she would be CMO, and pressors were stopped. She expired soon thereafter. 2. Dehydration. Received 2 liters of normal saline in the emergency department. Now on exam there may be a component of left heart failure with bibasilar rales. Patient is TBW overloaded with lower extremity edema (it is unusual for her to have LE edema and none noted on her admission exam last month). Fluids were initially given carefully (concern for 3rd spacing with history of CHF), but she developed hypotension (systolics to the 70-80's). She was given multiple fluid boluses without improvement in blood pressure (lasix held). Due to inability to maintain adequate blood pressure, she was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring. As above, fluids and pressors were used without success (also received PRBC initially upon transfer). 3. ARF: Creatinine at baseline was 1.3-1.6. Her creatinine continued to rise and was 3.4 at time of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (with minimal urine output). Cause of this was thought to be a combination of prerenal azotemia (FeNa calculated as 0.3%) and secondary to dye nephropathy (got CT scan on [**5-16**] with IV contrast, did receive IVF prior to scan). Creatinine continued to rise, and she expired from presumed sepsis as above (blood pressure without response to fluids and pressors). 4. CHF. LVEF from [**1-11**] is 45%, unclear if her systolic dysfunction has progressed. CXR today with possible asymmetric right sided pulmonary edema. Patient with excellent oxygen saturation on 2L NC initially. When bolused for low SBP's, she continued to accumulate peripheral edema. Repeat TTE showed EF=60% with 1-2+ MR. As above, CVP was somewhat elevated when measured in the ICU (?diastolic dysfunction). 5. Palpitations. Patient has a history of palpitations and was on a KOH monitor as an outpatient. She was initially monitored on telemetry with no events. 6. Code status: on discussion with patient and her daughter, it was decided that that she did not want untubation or compressions but would get shocks if necessary. This was maintained upon transfer to the ICU. When fluid resuscitation and pressors were ineffective, she was made CMO and expired in the ICU. Medications on Admission: Medications on Admission: 1.

Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**] Chief Complaint: Dizziness Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Angiogram with aneurysm coil [**2189-3-20**] Intubation History of Present Illness: 66 year old female who reports dizziness since [**Month (only) 1096**]. She was scheduled for a MRI today by her Primary Care physician to further diagnose her dizziness and was found to have a large vertebral artery aneurysm. She presented today to the ED for further workup and management. She reports seeing floaters in her visual fields for the past few months and states that her legs feel "heavier" or "weaker", but denies any recent falls, use of cane or walker,or her legs giving out on her. She denies bowel and bladder incontinence, numbness or tingling sensation, other visual disturbance, nausea, vomiting, headache. She reports a chronic productive cough. Past Medical History: Left proximal PICA aneurysm w/mass effect on brainstem s/p coiling Emphysema Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Cholecystectomy Peripheral vascular disease, mild celiac stenosis and moderate-to-severe SMA stenosis s/p stent [**8-15**] with known [**Female First Name (un) 899**] occlusion. S/P left ankle fracture Tobacco abuse Appendectomy Depression Social History: She is married with four living children. Tobacco - quit in [**8-15**](prior 1 pack per day x 56 years. She works as bookkeeper for her husband [**Name (NI) **] Family History: Her mother and father both had cancer (unclear which type) Physical Exam: Vitals: T99.9 BP 103/92 HR 94 RR 33 100% 40% FIO2 Gen: intubated, awake and alert, following commands, no acute distress Neck: supple, no JVD CV: RRR, nl s1/s2, no appreciable murmur Resp: vented breath sounds, decreased BS at bases, no wheezing Abd: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding Ext: warm, no edema Pertinent Results: CTA Head and Neck: 1. 3.2 cm extra-axial mass centered in the cerebello-pontine cistern on the left avidly enhances following contrast administration, and may originate from the proximal portion of the left PICA (though not from the origin). Most likely, this represents a giant aneurysm. However, given that it enhances slightly less than blood pool, unusual appearance of a mass lesion such as meningioma or other extra-axial neoplasm should also be considered. MRI and angiography may be helpful for further evaluation. 2. Emphysema. ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS: IMPRESSION: 1. Left upper pole homogeneously enhancing kidney lesion may represent a complicated cyst; however, further characterization of this cyst with MRI is recommended to exclude cystic renal cell carcinoma. 2. Indeterminate left adrenal lesion likely represents adenoma. This could be confirmed at the time of MRI. 3. Dilation of the hepatic ducts may be related to ampullary stenosis or reflect postsurgical change. MRI would be helpful to further exclude a malignancy. 4. Moderate emphysema. 5. Right lower quadrant lymph node and associated stranding are nonspecific. They may relate to infectious process or recent procedure. Clinical correlation is recommended. [**2189-3-31**] MRI Abdomen: 1) Limited study due to limited breath-holding capacity and lack of intravenous gadolinium. 2) Left adrenal adenoma. 3) Left renal cyst in question appears completely simple, but can be re- assessed at the time of MRCP with intravenous gadolinium. 4) Mild bilie duct dilatation with the suggestion of some debris within the common duct. Dedicated MRCP is recommended for further assessment when the patient is able and an IV can be placed. 5) Bibasilar consolidation and effusions, new compared to the CT of [**2189-3-17**], likely secondary to aspiration.

She reported seeing floaters in her visual fields and leg heaviness over the past few months. Denies falls, incontinence, visual disturbance. CT Head and Neck demonstrated a 3.2 cm extra-axial mass centered in the cerebello-pontine cistern on the left, consistent with a giant aneurysm. HCT dropped to 21.6 on [**3-17**], med consult obtained and she was transfused 2U PRBC. CT torso demonstrated several indeterminate lesions (L adrenal, L kidney). ECHO: EF >55%. She underwent coiling of the anuerysm on [**3-20**]. She was placed on a heparin drip following the procedure. She had an episode of desaturation immediately after extubation and received a bolus of Glycopyrrolate, and Neostigmine for suspected residual paralysis. She developed a slight worsening left sided weakness on [**3-21**] w/ right sided sensory deficit, per nsurg c/w Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary infarct). Also developed a femoral hematoma, but follow-up US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula. CT head stable on [**3-22**]. Sputum was obtained on [**3-22**] given worsening hypoxemia and thick secretions, grew Moraxella and ceftriaxone was started. During her first stay in the MICU, it was suspected that she was having aspiration events. Passed bedside swallow eval, but due to high suspicion for aspiration a barium swallow was performed with aspiration of barium into the lungs. Antibiotics were switched to Vanc/Zosyn and she required intubation for worsening respiratory distress. A BAL was performed with washout of the barium. She was extubated and transferred to floor on [**2189-3-29**]. On floor, she continued to be tenuous for a respiratory perspective with high oxygen requirements. This was believed to be multi-factorial from VAP, repeated aspiration events, poor cough and baseline lung disease. A repeat speech and swallow evaluation showed evidence of aspiration with deficits consistent with neurological deficit and it was decided to proceed with PEG tube placement on [**3-31**]. Following PEG placement, she had an episode of acute desaturation on the floor to 60% on NRB. She was reintubated and retransferred to the ICU. Hypoxemia was most likely [**2-9**] mucous plugging given that it resolved following ET suctioning. She was extubated the following morning however continued to require chest pt, pulmonary toilet and significant supplemental O2. She did have several episodes of acute desaturation due to mucous plugging which resolved with chest pt and suctioning. Problem [**Name (NI) **]: #Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Aspiration Pneumonia: [**2-9**] aspiration of barium, with persistent thick secretions. She has had recurrant difficulties due to mucous plugging exacerbated by generalized weakness and overall deconditioning. At the time of transfer to rehab she is -continue with chest PT every 4-8 hours -continue standing guaifensin for thinning of secretions -physical therapy and ambulation -incentive spirometry -albuterol/ipratropium nebs -acapella device -oxygen by 4-6L NC or 40%-50% humidified face mask . #Dysphagia, left sided weakness - likely [**2-9**] giant PICA aneurysm. Stable throughout admission with no change on serial head CT. She is s/p PEG placement for dysphagia and aspiration. -discharge to PT for rehab -would benefit from repeat swallow study once strenght improved to determine if dysphagia resolves. #Urinary Retention - she has had foley catheter throughout the majority of her admission. It was removed at one point however replaced due to persistent retention. On [**4-16**] her foley was discontinued and she was straight cathed q shift for urinary retention. -continue to straight cath q4-6 hours. If her urinary retention does not resolve in [**1-9**] days she will likely require replacement of her foley catheter with outpatient urology follow up. She had a urinalysis sent on [**4-16**] which did not show any evidence of UTI. #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia: Her baseline hematocrit is mid 20's with a ferritin of 6. Outside hospital records were obtained for EGD and colonscopy in [**6-15**] which showed only ischemic colonic ulcer. She was continued on PO iron supplementation after receiving 8 days of IV iron repletion. She had this discontinued secondary to constipation and will continue on ferrous sulfate. She should receive a colonoscopy to evaluate the iron deficiency anemia. EGD performed during PEG placement revealed duodenitis for which she was placed on lansoprazole through the PEG tube. . #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: These were identified on Abdominal CT with concern for malignancy. An abdominal MRI was attempted, but she was unable to tolerate this due to difficulty holding breath for extended periods of time. She will need an outpatient MRI for further characterization sometime in near future once her respiratory status is stable enough to tolerate lying flat. . #. PVD: Had evidence of ischemic colitis in [**2188-6-8**] and a BMS was placed in SMA on [**8-15**]. She was continued on plavix and ASA, these were discontinued for placement of PEG tube and restarted following this procedure. . #.Anxiety/Depression ?????? On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] at home. Pt has PMHx of depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and family concern for depression during this admission. Citalopram was started empirically. She will need outpatient psychiatry follow-up. Psychiatry evaluated patient and would recommend adding mirtazipine once she is stable from a pulmonary standpoint given risk of sedation and possible aspiration with this medication. She was given an occasional one time extra dose of alprazolam for her anxiety. A TSH was checked which was elevated at 7.1 with normal FT4 likely due to either sick euthyroid or subclinical hypothyroidism. She will need repeat TSH to determine cause and whether treatment is needed.

Dyphagia s/p PEG placement Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Tolerating PO's. Improving neurologically. Requiring 4-6L NC or 40-50% humidified face mask. She has slight left sided weakness and dysphagia from her cerebral aneurysm. She has thick secretions and requires assistance with chest PT and suctioning to clear secretions. If acutely desaturates, most likely due to mucous plugging. Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with an aneurysm in your brain that was embolized. After the procedure you had difficulty swallowing and aspirated into your lungs which caused difficulty breathing requiring intubation. You developed a pneumonia that was treated with antibiotics and aggressive lung rehab. Please inform you doctor or return to ED if you experience loss of vision, blurring, double vision, half vision, slurring of speech or difficulty finding correct words to use, severe headache or worsening headache not controlled by pain medication, sudden change in the ability to move or use your arm or leg or the ability to feel your arm or leg, trouble swallowing, breathing, or talking, numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities, temperature greater than 101.5F for 24 hours. Followup Instructions: Please call your primary care doctor as your CT scan of the chest this hospital admission indicates emphysema. You also had some abnormal findings on your CT scan that requires follow-up with an abdominal MRI. Please arrange this with your outpatient provider once stable. Please follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Neurosurgery in one month. The number to call and schedule this appointment is [**Telephone/Fax (1) **].

Patchy opacity is seen in the left lower lobe/lingular area. The right lung appears clear. There is slight biapical pleural thickening. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Several calcified nodes are seen in the left hilum. In addition, there appears to be a calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe. There may be a small left pleural effusion. The osseous structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Left lower lobe/lingular patchy consolidation. 2. Calcified nodes/granuloma suggestive of past granulomatous infection. EKG NSR 78bpm, nl axis, no ST or T wave changes [**2140-12-2**]: Chest AP The heart is enlarged but stable. The aorta is tortuous. There are calcified lymph nodes in the AP window and left hilum and there are calcified granulomas in the left mid and right upper lung zones. These findings, as well as an area of right apical thickening are stable. The lungs demonstrate no focal areas of consolidation. No definite pleural effusions are identified on the single projection. As compared to the recent study, there is improved visualization of the left retrocardiac area. Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo F with dementia, CHF? who presentedunresponsive at psych facility with hypercarbic respiratory failure. * 1) Respiratory Failure- We thought that her respiratory failure was multifactorial in etiology. The patient is perhaps hypercarbic at baseline. Pt likely hyper carbic at base line. We thought that pnemonia exacerbated her possible COPD/OSA/ obesity hypoventilation to the point where she decompensated. We also found that a pannus in the upper cervical spine which might have contributed to the patient's apnea. (see neuro below). The patient was transferred to the MICU where she was intubated then weaned to pressure support and then successfully extubated on [**11-23**]. She was then weaned off oxygen onto room air. * 2)Pneumonia exaceCeftriaxone/azith were started on admission which was eventually changed to levofloxacin such that she completed a 10 day course. * 3)Obstructive sleep apnea: She continued to desaturate periodically at night for which she was started on bipap with good effect but the patient refused to wear the bipap mask. She also underwent an inpatient sleep study but this was terminated early secondary to her refusal to wear the bipap mask. (An interpreter was present.) * 4)Psych - Pt was originally started on her home psych meds (see meds on admission). However zyprexa and depakote were stopped due to possible respiratory depression. Psychiatry was consulted and they thought that the patient had dementia and resolving delerium. Her standing haldol was discontinued and she was started on zyprexa prn agitation. * 5) Neuro - CT of the head demonstrated basal ganlia lesion and a pannus in the upper cervical spine. MRI done to further evaluate which demonstrated: a Posterior vertebral pannus formation C1-C2, with compression/stenosis of the spinal cord as it exits the foramen magnum. There was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, or minor or major vascular territorial infarction. Chronic lacunar infarcts were also observed Neurosurg consulted. The spoke to the pts home neurosurgeon at [**Hospital 189**] Hospital and found that this was a problem that had already been worked up. Because of her poor baseline functional status the pt was felt to be a poor surgical candidate. She was placed in a cervical collar which she refused to wear. * 6)In light of the continued improvement in her mental status we (the medical team and the patient's family) thought that it would be best if the patient were transferred to a rehab/long term care center where she could prepare for the upcoming surgery should her family decide to procede. At this time the family deferred surgery in light of her condition.

The patient with positive blood cultures. TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast CT imaging of the chest. Comparison is made with CT of the chest performed on [**2139-2-16**]. CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a large soft tissue density consistent with a hematoma adjacent to the lateral aspect of the aortic arch, which measures approximately 5.6 x 3.7 cm. On the prior examination of [**2139-2-16**] this periaortic hematoma measured approximately 3.6 x 1.7 cm. There is apparent disruption of calcification along the lateral contour of the aorta that is new when compared to the prior examination of [**2139-2-16**] seen best on (series 2, image 21). There is an significantly increased size of a left-sided pleural effusion. The pleural fluid on the left measures approximately 20 Hounsfield unit. A small left-sided pneumothorax was seen on the prior examination with the left- sided pleural fluid measuring approximately 40 Hounsfield units. A small right-sided pleural effusion appears unchanged. Multiple calcified pleural plaques are seen bilaterally. The heart is enlarged with a pacemaker in place. The stomach is dilated and fluid fills the lower esophagus. Likely atelectasis is present within the left lung base. No pulmonary nodules are seen. No pericardial effusion is seen. In the visualized portions of the upper abdomen, a distended stomach is seen. The spleen and visualized portion of the liver are within normal limits. There are dense nephrograms seen bilaterally. A stone versus retained contrast is seen within the mid left kidney. Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. IMPRESSION: 1) Increased size of a mediastinal hematoma adjacent to the patient's known aortic arch pseudoaneurysm. This finding cannot be further evaluated without IV contrast; however, however, this suggests worsening of mediastinal hemorrhage. 2) Increased size of left-sided pleural effusion with associated Hounsfield units of 20. This finding could represent a reactive pleural effusion or subacute hemothorax given the presence of blood within the pleural space on the prior CT of [**2139-2-16**]. 3) Dense bilateral nephrograms presumably reflecting contrast nephropathy in the absence of recent contrast administration. 4) Calcified pleural plaques are consistent with prior asbestos exposure. These findings were discussed with the clinical team responsible for this patient's care at the time of interpretation. Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to surgery found pseudoaneurysm/contained aortic rupture at aortic arch, treated for low hct withtransfusion, found to have high wbc and was cultured. As the lesion was not suitable for surgery in this patient with multiple co-morbidities, pt was transferred to the CCU team for medical management. Treated for pseudoaneurysm with bp control, blood cultures here with SA (MRSA in blood in past) tx with Linezolid as "allergic" to Vancomycin. Concern for mycotic aneurysm v. endocarditis, TTE negative, TEE planned for am. Pacer felt to be unlikely source and considering CT abdomen with contrast once renal function improves to evaluated possibility that bifem graft is site of infection. Pt developed more horseness - ENT consulted and found some paralysis of left vocal cord, consistent with left recurrent laryngeal nerve compression Repeat CT was obtained as this new horseness made the team concerned for growth of pseudoaneurysm. This showed that the previously observed hematoma adjacent to the aortic pseudoaneurysm was increasing. Confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of CT surgery that he is not operative candidate.

Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**] Chief Complaint: chest pain Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement History of Present Illness: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of HTN, Type II DM, and Paget dz who presents with chest pain for two days. Difficulty obtaining history directly from patient, as patient's hearing aide was not functioning when she arrived in the ICU. Per report and the patient's family, patient was complaining of pleuritic right-sided chest pain for the past two days at rehab. Today, she was transferred from rehab to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of both her chest pain and for monitoring her urine output in the setting of newly diagnosed bladder mass. She did not have any other symptoms. . In the ED, initial vitals were 97.2 109/55 HR 92 RR 14 100%. A chest PA and lateral was obtained with evidence of RLL. The patient was going to be admitted to the floor, but developed a fever to 103.9. Blood and urine cultures obtained. Patient also had episode of SVT (? a. fib) with RVR and received diltiazem 30 mg PO x 1 and 10 mg IV x 1. She also received levofloxacin. She was then admitted to the ICU given concern for SVT and septic physiology. . Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient's hearing aide was not working, and she could not provide a history. Her family was at the bedside, and corroborated the above history. . The family reports the patient has declined since a recent admission for complicated UTI. She was discharged to rehab, evaluated by urology/urogyn, and reportedly has a "bladder mass" which requires a foley catheter to avoid obstruction. The patient had the catheter removed 5 days ago. She has just completed a treatment course of metronidazole for (+) C. diff. . Review of systems: Per family, did not have any other symptoms apart from pleuritic right-sided chest pain.

Note is made of a tortuous aorta with atherosclerotic calcification. Lung volumes are low and there is a right lower lobe posterior opacity. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Note is made of bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe opacity, worrisome for pneumonia. Recommend clinical correlation as pulmonary infarct is also in the differential. If clinical picture is compatible with pneumonia, recommend follow-up chest radiograph in [**3-13**] weeks to document resolution. [**7-21**]: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient with right lower lobe pneumonia. Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with comparison to [**2192-7-20**] radiograph. There is significant interval worsening of right lower lobe consolidation, findings that are most likely consistent with interval aspiration given the rapidity of the change. Pulmonary hemorrhage would be another possibility if the patient has clinical condition pre-disposing to that. Right pleural effusion is noted, new. [**7-22**] There is interval improvement of the right basal consolidation, most likely consistent with partial resolution or aspiration.

RLL locale consistent with recent aspiration event. Patient has minimal O2 requirement, but is hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] V/Q mismatch in setting of infiltrate and possible atelectasis. Must also consider VTE given tachycardia, hypoxia, and pleuritic chest pain. Given more likely diagnosis of pneumonia, modified [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] criteria is 4, which suggests deferring CTA chest. Patient was covered broadly for HCAP with vanc, cefepime, and levoflox with intent to complete 10 day course given lack of sputum sample. Legionella antigen was negative. Patient received intermittent IVF boluses to maintain MAP > 65. She was placed on aspiration precautions, and oxygen was weaned as tolerated. Patient's code status was confirmed DNR/DNI with HCP. [**Name (NI) **] had persistent hypotension despite multiple boluses of IVF, and family meeting was held on [**2192-7-23**]. [**Name (NI) **] HCP and family wished to pursue transition from IVF and antibiotics to comfort measures only after additional family members visited with patient on [**2192-7-24**]. Palliative care was involved and following discussion with family we decided to pursue comfort measures on [**7-25**]. IV antibiotics and fluids were withdrawn. Ms [**Known lastname 23**] was comfortable, non-verbal at time of discharge. She was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] facility with goals of comfort care with PO morphine for discomfort and pain. . # Right-sided hemiparesis- Per PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 228**] baseline SBP generally much higher than admission SBP.

Pain / anxiety control. Patient comfortable, non-responsive at time of discharge. Discharge Instructions: Ms [**Known lastname 23**] was admitted for worsening chest pain and signs and symptoms concerning for sepsis and pneumonia. She required a stay in the ICU for treatment of her pneumonia. Around this time she developed right sided upper extremity weakness likely consistent with new stroke. Imaging was deferred. Given her pneumonia and new stroke signs, we had a discussion with the patient's family and decided to focus on comfort for her goals of care. She was transferred from the intensive care unit to the hospital floor, where her intravenous fluids and antibiotics were withdrawn. Pain control was ordered as necessary to control pain. She was discharged to an [**Hospital3 **] facility with comfort care goals established. Followup Instructions: None

Mild mass effect on the adjacent 4th ventricle. CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE NECK: The origins of the great arch vessels are included. The right subclavian artery is mildly tortuous. The left vertebral artery is mildly tortuous along its origin and is dominant. The contour and caliber of each vertebral artery is within normal limits. There is no carotid stensosis. Only minimal mural thickening along the origin of each internal carotid artery is noted. There are no calcifications. The distal right and left internal carotid artery each measure 4 mm in diameter. CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: The major cerebral arteries, including the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery, appear widely patent. There is partial fetal-type circulation of the right posterior cerebral artery with a relatively small right P1 segment. There are no areas of stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation. There is also no evidence for an arteriovenous malformation MRI/MRA: Acute right posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarct. Mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle. Normal MRA of the neck. The MRA of the neck demonstrates normal flow signal within the carotid and vertebral arteries. The left vertebral artery is dominant. No evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis seen. TTE: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal global systolic function. Dilated thoracic aorta. No definite cardiac source of embolism identified. TEE: No source of cardiac embolism found. Patient did have simple (less than 4mm) plaque in the aorta in several locations. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 75415**] is a 53 y/o male admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] neurosurgical ICU service on [**2158-10-7**] for lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere. No neuro deficit found on the initial neurosurgical exam. An MRI brain showed a new infarct in the Right cerebellum. Neurology was consulted and he was transferred to their service for further work-up. An MRA showed normal flow within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation, however the distal right vertebral artery was small. The MRA of the neck was normal. His stroke work-up consisted on a TTE which showed LVH but no intracardiac source of thrombus. A TEE was done to further explore the possibility of thrombus but none was visualized. His LDL was 170 and he was started on simvastatin 40mg QD after LFTs were normal. His A1c was 5.7 and his BS were mostly wnl. He was also treated with ASA 325 for secondary stroke prevention. His BP was often elevated, especially the diastolic up to 120's. He was treated with metoprolol and gradually titrated up with a good BP response. 5 days after his admission, he was noted to have brief runs of afib on tele. He was started on Coumadin 5mg and not anticoagulated with a heparin drip given the size of his stroke. He will need to remain on Aspirin 325 until his INR reaches 1.9, after which it can be discontinued. He also had brief episodes of bradycardia with HR in the 30's. He was asymptomatic during these events. His PM Metoprolol dose was decreased to 12.5mg and he stopped having these episodes. His symptom of vertigo persisted and his exam remained significant for R evoked gaze nystagmus. HE IS CURRENTLY ON ASPIRIN AND COUMADIN. PLEASE STOP ASPIRIN WHEN THE INR IS > 2.

Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Coumadin / Xanax / Morphine Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**] Chief Complaint: Lower extremity edema Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None. History of Present Illness: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, CHF (EF of 25-30% per report in [**2168**]), who presents with a 2 week history of worsening lower extremity edema. Per the patient and his nephew, the patient was in his normal state of health until approximately 1 month ago. At this time, the patient developed progressive lower extremity edema, DOE, and fatigue, and presented to [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**9-7**]. While there, the patient was diuresed with 40 mg IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **] and discharged to home with physical therapy. Two weeks later, the patient again presented to OSH with a similar presentation and was again diuresed and returned home. Since this time, the patient states that his legs have been increasing in size, he has had DOE, and he overall feels extremely fatigued. The patient states that he is taking 60 mg of Lasix twice daily, and he has been faithful in taking this medication. The patient also denies dietary indiscretion, but does admit to eating quite a lot of soup at home. . In the ED, the patient's VS were T 97.0, P 63, BP 135/80, R 20, O2 99% on RA. The patient received 40 mg IV Lasix and diuresed well. Cardiac enzymes were drawn, which were within his normal range. CXR was performed which showed a LLL effusion. The patient was then admitted to CC7 for further workup and evaluation. . On review of systems, the patient denies he denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. All of the other review of systems were negative. He endorses a prior stroke, GI Bleed. . . . ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, CHF (EF 20%), and multiple admissions recently for lower extremity edema, who presents with a 2-week history of lower extremity edema. . #. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a h/o CHF, with an EF of 20%. The patient has had multiple admissions over the past month for lower extremity edema. He is currently taking 60 mg PO Lasix [**Hospital1 **], and he states that he has been faithful with this regimen. He does, however, endorse dietary indiscretion, which may in fact be unawareness of what a low-sodium diet entails. On physical exam, the patient has 4+ pitting edema up to his hips bilaterally, scrotal edema, and elevated JVP. The patient is most likely having a CHF exacerbation secondary to likely dietary indiscretion v. worsening cardiac function s/p MI v. medication non-compliance. - Lasix 60 mg IV now - Continue to measure accurate I/O q4h - Low-sodium diet with 1200 cc fluid restriction - Nutrition C/S for dietary education - TEDs in order to optimize preload. - Consider TTE in am in order to assess for further cardiac dysfunction. . #. Acute Renal Failure: Patient presented with Cr of 1.8, which is elevated from his baseline of 1.5. The patient is still making urine, and he diuresed well to 40 mg IV Lasix. On his last admission at [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**], the patient's Cr increased in the setting of diuresis. It appears that patient's acute on chronic renal failure is most likely a pre-renal etiology in the setting of CHF and poor forward flow v. obstruction v. ATN/AIN. - Lasix 60 mg IV now and continue with plan for CHF as outlined above - Send urine Na, Cr, and Urea in light of diuretic use to calculate FeUrea - Continue to trend Cr and UOP . #. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a h/o CAD. He is not currently having any symptoms of chest pain. Cardiac enzymes were elevated in the ED, though they appear to be at his baseline (0.10) and the patient does not have any significant ECG changes on admission. The patient's troponins are most likely elevated in the setting of acute renal failure. - Continue to monitor patient clinically - Repeat ECG in the am - Continue home dose of Metoprolol, NTG, Simvastatin . #. Gout: Patient has a history of gout. He currently takes Allopurinol 300 mg daily at home. Given the patient's renal function, this dose was changed to Allopurinol 100 mg daily. - Continue lower dose of Allopurinol given ARF. . #. GERD: Continue patient's home dose of Ranitidine. . #.

Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a h/o CHF, with an EF of 20%. The patient has had multiple admissions over the past month for lower extremity edema. Prior to this admission, he was taking 60 mg PO Lasix [**Hospital1 **], and he stated that he had been faithful with this regimen. He did, however, endorse dietary indiscretion, and was thus seen by Nutrition during this admission for dietary instruction. He also had an ECHO performed, which did not show any evidence of interval change from his prior ECHO in [**2170-6-22**]. The patient was started on Lasix IV, which was eventually increased to a Lasix drip. The patient became very hypotensive with SBP to the 70s with this intervention, and he developed altered mental status. The patient was thus transferred to the CCU, where he was placed on Lasix and Milrinone drips. He diuresed 7 L over the course of five days. The patient was then started on Torsemide and Digoxin, which he should continue to take as an outpatient. The patient's lower extremity edema had decreased on this admission, and he was set up with a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**]. . #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient presented with Cr of 1.8, which is elevated from his baseline of 1.5. The patient continued to make urine during this admission, and his Cr initially improved with diuresis. It was thought that patient's acute on chronic renal failure was most likely a pre-renal etiology in the setting of CHF and poor forward flow. The patient's Cr, however, increased again in the setting of more aggressive diuresis but was decreasing at the time of discharge. . #. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a h/o CAD. He was not having any symptoms of chest pain at the time of admission. Cardiac enzymes were elevated in the ED, though they appeared to be at his baseline (0.10) and the patient did not have any significant ECG changes on admission. The patient's troponins were most likely elevated in the setting of acute renal failure. He was monitored on telemetry during this admission, and he was continued on his home dose of Metoprolol, Nitroglycerin, and Simvastatin. . #. Gout: The patient has a history of gout. Prior to admission, he was taking Allopurinol 300 mg daily at home. Given the patient's renal function, this dose was changed to Allopurinol 100 mg daily during this admission. He did not have any acute events during this admission. . #. GERD: The patient has a history of GERD. He was continued on his home dose of Ranitidine during this admission.

She was referred for surgical intervention. After 7 day of Plavix washout, she underwent CABG x4 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. She weaned from bypass on Milrinone, vasopressin,Levophed and Propofol. An IABP was necessary as well. She stabilized, the balloon pump was removed on POD 1 and pressors were weaned over a couple of days. Diuresis was begun, she remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint but required extensive pulmonary toilet and diuresis. A CT was placed for a large pleural effusion and she was able to be extubated on POD 8. She had recurrent atrial fibrillation, despite amiodarone and attempts at cardioversion, and Coumadin was begun. She did convert to sinus rhythm eventually. Beta blockers were begun, however, they were discontinued on [**2-7**] for bradycardia, the rhythm remaining sinus. Coumadin was continued due to the postoperative atrial fibrillation. her target INR is 2-2.5. She stabilized and with vigorous diuresis and pulmonary toilet progressed slowly. She was neurologically intact. Physical therapy worked with her for strength and mobilization. She was transferred to a rebabilitation facility for further recovery prior to eventual return to home.

Discharge Date: Service: VSU CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bilateral ankle ulcerations. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 66-year old female with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease who presents with 6 weeks of bilateral medial malleolar ulcerations and bilateral lower extremity cellulitis (right greater than left). This has been complicated by a recent (4.5 weeks ago) medial malleolar fracture. The patient also complains of bilateral foot pain which is worse with a.m. ambulation. Ulcer healing has waxed and waned. The patient was referred here for further evaluation and treatment. She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, weakness, numbness, amaurosis, fevers, chills. Does admit to nausea. Denies vomiting. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Include Lipitor 10 mg daily, Avandia 4 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg daily, Zantac 150 mg b.i.d., Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Senokot tablets 1 b.i.d., allopurinol 100 mg b.i.d., Vicodin tablets 1 q.12h. p.r.n., Lasix 80 mg daily, Compazine 10 mg q.6h. p.r.n., Procrit 40,000 units subcutaneously weekly, Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide daily. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs of 98.5, 96, 22, blood pressure of 146/82, oxygen saturation of 95%. General appearance is a very pleasant white female in no acute distress. Neurological exam is remarkable for left facial drooping. Chest exam reveals lungs are with crackles bilaterally at the bases. Heart has a regular rate and rhythm without murmur. HEENT exam shows bilateral carotid bruits and JVD. Abdominal exam is unremarkable. Extremity exam with 2+ edema bilaterally with shallow ulcerations on the medial aspect of both ulcerations. Pulse exam shows palpable radial's and femoral's bilaterally. DP's are triphasic signals only. PT's are monophasic Dopplerable signals on the right and triphasic on the left. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the vascular service. Wound cultures were obtained. Cardiology medicine was requested to see the patient because of her congestive heart failure on admission chest x-ray. The patient was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and treatment of congestive heart failure. The patient an echocardiogram done which showed symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with global and regional systolic dysfunction, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease or other diffuse process. In the absence of systolic hypertension and infiltrative process should be considered. There is moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular cavity is enlarged, free wall is hypokinetic. The patient underwent a myocardial perfusion stress which demonstrated a transient dilatation of the left ventricle with stress. The stress perfusion images showed a moderate reduction in tracer distribution involving the mid and distal inferolateral wall. He rest perfusion images demonstrated this defect to be reversible. Stress perfusion images additionally demonstrate a moderate defect in the tracer uptake of the apex, and this defect was partially reversible. The stress also demonstrated moderately reversible defects in the mid and distal anteroseptal wall. Calculated ejection fraction was 29%. Once the patient was compensated for her congestive heart failure and her renal function stabilized, she underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2179-4-13**] with documented 3- vessel disease with markedly elevated and right and left- sided filling pressures. She underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/diagonal and an angioplasty to the LAD with partially successful PTCA of the right coronary. This was transected by catheter during the catheterization. The patient was transferred to the CCU for continued monitoring and rule out. Troponin levels were 0.59, 0.19, 0.08. The patient remained on the cardiology service. Aspirin, Plavix, and Lopressor were continued. She required a transfusion for a low hematocrit. This was related to her chronic myelodysplasia disorder. A transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained immediately post cardiac catheterization. There was a small pericardial effusion. There was no echocardiographic sign of tamponade. The patient did experience contrast renal failure post cardiac catheterization and required aggressive treatment for hyperkalemia. The peak creatinine was 3.0. The patient finally returned to baseline renal function with a creatinine of 1.9 on [**2179-4-21**]. The patient was transferred to the vascular service that same day. The patient was pre hydrated with Mucomyst and sodium bicarbonate infusion and underwent a peripheral arteriogram on [**2179-4-22**]. The patient tolerated the procedure. She was without hematoma, and her creatinine remained stable. The patient was seen by the orthopaedic service for her ankle fracture. Recommendations were bivalved cast with nonweightbearing and that further surgical orthopaedic intervention would be done after her cardiac and peripheral vascular problems were addressed. The patient requested on [**2179-4-23**] a desire to be discharged to home during the [**Holiday **] holiday. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] was agreeable. The patient has discussed this with family and made arrangements for discharge over the weekend. The patient will return on [**4-26**] to be readmitted for elective revascularization of the right lower extremity on [**2179-4-27**]. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1. Atorvastatin 80 mg daily. 2. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg daily. 3. Plavix 75 mg daily. 4. Metoprolol sustained release 50 mg daily. 5. Isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg daily. 6. Colace 100 mg b.i.d. 7. Protonix 40 mg daily. 8. Hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/500-mg tablets 1 to 2 tablets q.6h. p.r.n. (for pain). 9. Hydralazine 50 mg q.6h. 10. Calcium carbonate 500 mg daily. 11. Vitamin D3 400-unit tablet daily. 12. Glargine insulin 15 units at bedtime. 13. Regular insulin sliding scale before meals and at bedtime as follows: Glucose less than 150 use 1 unit, glucose of 151 to 200 use 3 units, glucose of 201 to 250 use 5 units, glucose of 251 to 300 use 7 units, glucose of 301 to 350 use 9 units, glucose of 351 to 400 use 11 patient will be instructed regarding insulin usage and administration prior to discharge. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bilateral medial malleolar ischemic ulcerations. 2. Type 2 diabetes; uncontrolled. 3. New insulin-dependent diabetic. 4. Myelodysplastic anemia; refractory - transfused. 5. Congestive heart failure; compensated. 6. Chronic renal insufficiency exacerbated by contrast- induced acute tubular necrosis. 7.

Wound cultures were obtained. Cardiology medicine was requested to see the patient because of her congestive heart failure on admission chest x-ray. The patient was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation and treatment of congestive heart failure. The patient an echocardiogram done which showed symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with global and regional systolic dysfunction, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease or other diffuse process. In the absence of systolic hypertension and infiltrative process should be considered. There is moderate pulmonary systolic hypertension, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular cavity is enlarged, free wall is hypokinetic. The patient underwent a myocardial perfusion stress which demonstrated a transient dilatation of the left ventricle with stress. The stress perfusion images showed a moderate reduction in tracer distribution involving the mid and distal inferolateral wall. He rest perfusion images demonstrated this defect to be reversible. Stress perfusion images additionally demonstrate a moderate defect in the tracer uptake of the apex, and this defect was partially reversible. The stress also demonstrated moderately reversible defects in the mid and distal anteroseptal wall. Calculated ejection fraction was 29%. Once the patient was compensated for her congestive heart failure and her renal function stabilized, she underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2179-4-13**] with documented 3- vessel disease with markedly elevated and right and left- sided filling pressures. She underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/diagonal and an angioplasty to the LAD with partially successful PTCA of the right coronary. This was transected by catheter during the catheterization. The patient was transferred to the CCU for continued monitoring and rule out. Troponin levels were 0.59, 0.19, 0.08. The patient remained on the cardiology service. Aspirin, Plavix, and Lopressor were continued. She required a transfusion for a low hematocrit. This was related to her chronic myelodysplasia disorder. A transesophageal echocardiogram was obtained immediately post cardiac catheterization. There was a small pericardial effusion. There was no echocardiographic sign of tamponade. The patient did experience contrast renal failure post cardiac catheterization and required aggressive treatment for hyperkalemia. The peak creatinine was 3.0. The patient finally returned to baseline renal function with a creatinine of 1.9 on [**2179-4-21**]. The patient was transferred to the vascular service that same day. The patient was pre hydrated with Mucomyst and sodium bicarbonate infusion and underwent a peripheral arteriogram on [**2179-4-22**]. The patient tolerated the procedure. She was without hematoma, and her creatinine remained stable. The patient was seen by the orthopaedic service for her ankle fracture. Recommendations were bivalved cast with nonweightbearing and that further surgical orthopaedic intervention would be done after her cardiac and peripheral vascular problems were addressed. The patient requested on [**2179-4-23**] a desire to be discharged to home during the [**Holiday **] holiday. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] was agreeable. The patient has discussed this with family and made arrangements for discharge over the weekend. The patient will return on [**4-26**] to be readmitted for elective revascularization of the right lower extremity on [**2179-4-27**]. Pt readmitted to vascular surgery for elective revascularization of the right lower extremity. On [**4-27**] patient underwent a Right femoral to anterior tibialis bypass graft with composite PTFE and vein graft. Transfered to the PACU in stable condition. Pt was transfused with 2 units PRBC post procedure. With the following drop in HCT a Heme/Onc consult was put in. They diagnosed the person with HITT, All heparin was DC'd. Pt' HCT and PLT improved after heparin items were Dc'd. On [**2179-5-3**] pt foley was DC'd, she was allowed OOB to chair, A PT / Case management consult was put in.

Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/hx of afib on coumadin, COPD, MR, TR who presented on [**2150-5-1**] from her nursing home with falls and questionable left facial droop. She was initially a code stroke in the ED. She was evaluated by neurology who determined that she did not have a stroke and she did not require further neurologic evaluation. She had CT head noncon and CTA head/neck, both were negative. She also had a negative urine and CXR except cardiomegaly. On admission she required 3L NC. Over the course of her hospitalization she has developed worsening hypoxia so that in the evening of [**2150-5-2**] she required 100% facemask. She was given 40mg IV Lasix and urinated 1700ml and improved to 2L NC. CTA done overnight showed no PE but did show bileratal pleural effusions L>R with LLL collapse and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Hypoxia: On admission patient had a new oxygen requirement, 3L nasal cannula, while at baseline she was on room air. Throughout her admission, patient denied shortness of breath but did complain of fatigue. Given her rapid heart rate, the patient underwent a CTA to rule out PE. CTA showed bilateral pleural effusions with LLL collapse, but no PE. Given CTA findings her initial presentation was thought to be secondary to heart failure, possibly exacerbated by a fib w/ RVR and she was diuresed with po lasix. CTA did show extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and so infectious vs. malignant etiologies were considered. . Over the course of her hospitalization, she required two admissions to the MICU. On [**2150-5-3**] she decompensated with hypoxia and A-fib with RVR with a question of aspiration event. Her a-fib was managed by increasing metoprolol dose and digoxin loading/maintenance with good HR (70s-80s) and BP control (110-120s). Given the rise in WBC, she was started and completed an 8 day course for HCAP with vanc and zosyn. She was diuresed in the with iv lasix. A TEE was done that showed diastolic dysfunction and BNP was elevated to 10K. CE were trended but were flat. She was transferred to the floor for further management. . On the floor patient improved with diuresis and antibiotic course. Her leukocytosis also downtrended. Speech and swallow consulted who did not see si/sx of aspiration. However, there remained concern that patient was aspirating and she was placed on aspiration precautions. She had another episode of hypoxia with afib and RVR requiring NRB; ABG on NRB showed 7.52/36/65/30 with lactate 4.8. She was transferred to the MICU a second time. A repeat Chest CT was concerning for right middle lobe pneumonia, patient weaned off to nasal cannula and lactate trended down. Patient was diuresed and transferred back to the floor. On [**5-12**], patient spiked a fever, and was started on iv meropenem and vanc for an 8 day course of aspiration pneumonia, and pan-cultured. She improved with antibiotics and defervesced. Urine and blood culture showed no growth on discharge. . Patient was managed with chest PT and aggressive pulmonary toilet. Pulmonology was consulted, who agreed with management of antibiotics, diuresis, and BP/rate control. Given her anatomy thoracentesis thought to be unlikely to result in re-expansion of her left lung. Goals of care were discussed further with patient. Patient decided that further MICU transfers were not align with her goals of care and decided to be DNI. Patient was discharged to nursing facility with plans to transition to hospice care. Ultimately decision was made with family and patient for do not hospitalize as this would not be consistent with patient's goals of care. - Continue iv vanc and meropenem until [**2150-5-20**] to complete 8 day course - Continue nasal cannula, wean as tolerated - Patient has decided to be: DNR/DNI/DNH . 2. Afib with RVR: This may have been precipitated by lung etiology given hypoxia. Blood pressure was initially stable though dipped into the low 100s systolic. She was on Metoprolol on admission which was increased to 75mg PO TID. Patient had several episodes of RVR to 160s which were managed with gentle bolus, with minimal response, then IV metoprolol and IV dilt. She was ruled out for an MI, and infectious work up was revealing for pneumonia. Her coumadin was initially held given her history of falls. This was restarted during her hospitalization. However, as patient remained hypoxic and weak, further discussions regarding risk/benefit of coumadin were had with patient and son. Ultimately, the immediate risks of bleed were thought to outweigh the long-run benefits. Coumadin was stopped on discharge. - Hold metoprolol or diltiazam if SBP<100, HR<60 . 3. Acute Heart Failure: CT scans notable for bilateral pleural effusions. A TTE was done that showed EF 55%, RV moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. CE were negative. She was maintained with lasix, bb, ccb, and digoxin. She was transitioned from iv lasix to 40mg PO lasix, to keep net even to 500cc net negative. - Suspect that lasix dose will need to be reduced. When patient stops iv antibiotics please determine new lasix dose by PO intake and fluid status. Consider reducing dose back to home dose of 10mg daily. . 4. Extensive Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: This was seen on CTA and the differential thought to include infection vs. malignancy. On repeat imaging, there was small improvement in lymphadenopathy after diuresis and antibiotic treatment. Pulmonology consulted and given goals of care (as stated above), further invasive work up was not in line with patient's wishes. As stated above she spiked a temp [**5-12**] and was pan-cultured and started on vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] x8days for aspiration pna. . 5. Leukocytosis: Seen by hematologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 49104**] at [**Location (un) **], with leukocytosis in the past in 13s-17s. Throughout her admission, WBC ranged from 9 to 30 w/ primarily PMN diff (90s). She was treated for pneumonia infection with two course of antibiotics which improved her leukocytosis. . 6. Thrombocytosis: It was confirmed w/ her outpatient hematologist that patient has a known JACK2 mutation by PCR. She was continued on Hydroxyurea 3 days per week. Medications on Admission: 1.

You were admitted because you fell and because of shortness of breath. Your shortness of breath was from volume overload from your heart failure, lung collapse, and infection. We treated you with lasix, antibiotics, and inhalers. You also had a very fast heart rate due to your atrial fibrillation. We increased your metoprolol and started you on a new medication called digoxin. While you were here we did a chest CT that showed opacities and enlarged lymph nodes in the lung. A pulmonologist saw you and you agreed that you did not want further invasive testing. You also decided that you did not want any ICU tranfers and to change your code status from do not resuscitate (DNR) and okay to intubate, to DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate and do not intubate). We have made the following changes to your medications: 1. We have changed your metoprolol to metoprolol succinate daily for your atrial fibrillation 2. We have started you on digoxin for atrial fibrillation 3. We have stopped your cephalexin 4. We have started you on lidocaine patch for pain 5. We have started you on vancomycin and meropenem for aspiration pneumonia 6. We have increased your lasix dose to 40mg daily 7.

Pulmonary: Diffuse expiratory wheezing noted, decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases. Cardiac: Tachy, irregular, nl. S1S2, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at LUSB. Abdomen: Obese, soft, NT, + distention, decreased bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted. Extremities: 2+ edema to thigh bilaterally, no c/c. dopplerable DP pulses b/l. Neurologic: -mental status: Alert, oriented x 3. Anxious, asking why she is here. -cranial nerves: II-XII intact -motor: normal bulk, strength and tone throughout. No abnormal movements noted. -sensory: No deficits to light touch throughout. Pertinent Results: [**8-15**] CXR: Limited single bedside AP view labeled "upright in EU" patient lordotically positioned, as compared with most recent study dated [**2168-3-30**], more remote study dated [**2167-3-8**], and CT of the chest dated [**2166-9-18**]. The study is quite limited by, among other things, the patient's habitus. However, again demonstrated are multifocal patchy airspace opacities, likely unchanged since the most recent and the [**2166**] study, but largely new since the [**8-26**] CT. These may, therefore, represent chronic consolidations of unknown etiology. There is evidence of left ventricular, left atrial and central pulmonary arterial enlargement, with no definite pulmonary vascular engorgement. There is hazy opacity involving both CP angles, and small effusions are possible. [**2168-8-16**] Abd U/S - Limited study as stated without obvious hepatic abnormality. No free fluid identified. [**2168-8-16**] CXR - In comparison with the study of [**8-15**], there is little overall change. Again, there are scattered areas of patchy air space opacification, unchanged since the 20/06 study that may therefore represent some chronic changes of unknown etiology. Generalized enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is seen with mild vascular engorgement. Haziness of the costophrenic angles raises the possibility of small effusions. [**2168-8-19**] CXR - Extremely limited examination. No significant interval change. [**2168-8-20**] CXR - Limited study secondary to patient positioning. New placement of a left internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter. The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right lobar or segmental pulmonary artery. No pneumothorax identified. [**2168-8-21**] CXR - The endotracheal tube tip is at the level of the aortic knob. There is a left-sided Swan-Ganz catheter with the distal lead tip in the right pulmonary artery. There is a right-sided IJ catheter with distal lead tip in the proximal SVC, unchanged. There is again seen cardiomegaly which is stable. There are airspace opacities within both lung bases, stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen and is also unchanged. Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 71 yo F with diastolic dysfunction, DM, HTN admitted with shock and respiratory failure. Respiratory failure. Likely a large component of diastolic dysfunction with elevated right heart pressures +/- obesity hypoventilation +/- PNA. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure. She received antibiotic therapy for an acinetobacter pneumonia (grown in the sputum). She underwent aggressive cardiac monitoring including Swan-Ganz catheterization after echocardiogram revealed a dilated RV. Despite these measures, the patient was ventilator dependent. After approximately 2 weeks on the ventilator, the patient was terminally extubated in accordance with the family's wishes and in accordance with the patient's prior statements of not wanting prolonged life support. She passed within minutes of extubation on [**2168-8-31**] at 1:35PM due to respiratory failure. The family declined an autopsy.

Service: CSU HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 78-year-old female, with known ascending aortic aneurysm. The patient complains of recently shortness of breath with exertion and minimal epigastric indigestion with activity which resolves with rest. Cardiac catheterization done [**2185-3-22**] showed an ejection fraction of 54 percent, with a mid-LAD lesion of 30- 40 percent. Chest MRA in [**2185-7-14**] showed a 6.4 cm ascending aortic aneurysm. The patient had been originally scheduled for surgery in [**2185-4-14**]; however, at that time her surgery was canceled due to an esophageal tear. As an outpatient, the patient had a repeat upper endoscopy which showed a well- healed tear. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension. GERD. Cataract. Nephrolithiasis. Ascending aortic aneurysm. Status post cesarean section x 3. ALLERGIES: Aspirin which causes GI upset. IV dye which causes shaking chills. Shellfish which causes nausea and vomiting. PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS: 1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po qd. 2. Atenolol 50 mg po qd. 3. Milk of Magnesia prn. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smokes approximately a half pack per day with approximately 35-pack year. The patient denies ETOH. She lives alone in Rosalindale next door to her sister. HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on [**9-13**] for replacement of her aortic arch and her proximal descending aorta with an aorto- subclavian bypass and a vertebro-subclavian bypass. Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 214 minutes. Crossclamp time 43 minutes. Total circulatory arrest time was 50 minutes divided up into 3 intervals. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on Nitroglycerin and epinephrine drips. Upon admission to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was noted to have a small amount of blood draining from bilateral ears. ENT consult was obtained, and upon examination by the ENT staff, it was noted that the patient had blood behind her eardrums but no perforation, unclear etiology. Recommended antibiotic ear drops for 7 days and continued reassessment. The situation resolved, and the patient had no further issues. The patient had some labile hemodynamics immediately postop requiring correction of coagulopathy and transfusion of packed red blood cells, without significant chest tube output. The patient initially required increased PEEP for poor oxygenation. On postop day 1, the patient began to awaken, and it was felt that perhaps the patient had some mild right-sided weakness. At that time, the patient's goal blood pressure was increased, and the patient remained very sleepy for the next few days. Eventually, fully awoke and was found to be neurologically intact. The patient was started on Lasix with good diuresis. The patient was intermittently hypertensive due to stimulation. The patient was started on Lopressor. Continued to be on Nitroglycerin. The patient intermittently had been on sodium nitroprusside which caused hypoxia, and this was discontinued. The patient was started on Combivent inhalers with moderate improvement in her expiratory wheezes. On postoperative day 3, the patient had been placed on CPAP which had tolerated well. Towards the end of the day, the patient acutely became anxious, agitated and hypertensive, complaining that she was having trouble breathing. Chest x- ray was obtained at that time which was unremarkable. The patient was placed back on with resolution of the incident. On postoperative day 3, cardiology consult was obtained for assistance in managing hypertension. It was recommended to continue aggressive diuresis and continue current medical therapy. The patient was weaned on mechanical ventilation and extubated initially with hemodynamic instability, hypertension and tachycardia which resolved. The patient remained extubated approximately 2-1/2 hours, at which time she became acutely agitated, short of breath and tachypneic, and quickly progressed to respiratory failure. The patient was emergently reintubated. It was felt that her failure was due to volume overload. The patient was continued to be aggressively diuresed. The patient was started on Natrecor, as well as her Lasix to aid in diuresis and help with hypertension. The patient's creatinine had slowly begun to rise and peaked at approximately 2.1. The patient's sputum from [**9-18**] grew MRSA. The patient was started on IV vancomycin for treatment. The patient was started on tube feeds. The patient had several episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation for which she was started on amiodarone. All episodes were nonsustained. The patient underwent bronchoscopy which showed moderate secretions bilaterally which were aspirated, and moderate to severe malacia of the distal trachea. The patient continued to be aggressively diuresed and was extubated on [**9-22**], and due to the presence of tracheomalacia, the patient was extubated and placed on intermittent CPAP which was gradually weaned off, as the patient continued diuresis. The patient underwent a swallowing evaluation on [**9-23**] which showed no evidence of aspiration. The patient continued on her amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation. The patient was intermittently pleasantly confused which subsequently resolved. The patient developed an elevated white blood cell count on [**9-24**]. The patient was pancultured. The patient's UA was positive, and urine culture was subsequently negative. The patient had been started on levofloxacin. Repeat urine culture was sent on [**9-30**] with results still pending. The patient's Lasix was discontinued on [**9-26**] due to rise in creatine and patient being below preop weight. On [**9-27**], the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part of the hospital and began being screened for rehab. On [**9-30**], the patient was cleared for discharge to rehab. CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: T-max 97.6, pulse 75 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 129/80, respiratory rate 18, room air oxygen saturation 93 percent. The patient's weight on [**9-30**] was 68.5 kg, which was decreased from 69.3 on [**9-29**]. LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 16.1, hematocrit 36.6, platelet count 687, sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 106, bicarb 22, BUN 51, creatinine 1.9, glucose 81. PHYSICAL EXAM: Neurologically, the patient was awake, alert, oriented x 3. No apparent deficit. Her grip strength and her plantar flexion were equal bilaterally. Heart was regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur. Respiratory - breath sounds were coarse with scattered rhonchi throughout. The patient had a moderately productive cough, but was not expectorating any sputum. GI - positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended. The patient was tolerating a regular diet and having normal bowel movements. Extremities - pulses were 2 plus bilateral radials and 2 plus bilateral DP and PT. Extremities were warm and well-perfused without any evidence of edema. Sternal incision was clean, dry and intact. The sternum was stable without any erythema or drainage. The right subclavian incision had mild tenderness to palpation in the area of the incision with a small amount of separation at the lateral portion of the incision which was scabbed over. There was no erythema, and there was no drainage. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Amiodarone 200 mg po qd x 1 month. 2. Combivent MDI 1-2 puffs q 6 h prn. 3. Flovent 110 mcg MDI 2 puffs inhaled [**Hospital1 **]. 4. Nicotine 14 mg patch 1 transdermally qd x 3 weeks. 5. Protonix 40 mg po qd. 6. Lopressor 25 mg po bid. 7.

Severe diffuse bilateral airspace opacities might represent pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage or widespread infection. Further assessment with chest CT is recommended. 2. Endotracheal tube ending 4.8 cm above the carina ECHO [**2124-10-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire posterior wall, and hypokinesis (with regional variation) of the rest of the left ventricle - basal segments relatively well-preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. CXR [**2124-10-18**]: IMPRESSION: Almost complete resolution of bilateral diffuse airspace opacifications consistent with diagnosis of pulmonary edema. Cardiac MRI [**2124-10-20**]: Mildly enlarged left atrium and normal size right atrium. Increased left ventricular cavity. Thinned and akinetic antero-basal and mid-basal antero-lateral walls. Moderately hypokinesis of the other ventricular segments with probable dyssynchrony also present. Transmural late gadolinium enhancement of the antero-basal and mid-basal antero-lateral wall, consistent with fibrosis or scar, and low likelihood of contractile recovery after revascularization. No evidence of late gadolinium enhancement in the other, hypokinetic, left ventricular segments. Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The ascending aorta, descending aorta and main pulmonary artery were normal. No significant aortic or mitral regurgitation. No pericardial effusion. ECHO [**2124-10-25**]: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). There is global hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferior wall. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Regional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Normal right ventricular systolic function. No pathologic valvular abnormalities identified. CXR [**2124-10-26**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. In the interval, the patient has received a pacemaker, the generator is in left pectoral position, the course of the leads is unremarkable, the tip of the lead projects over the right ventricle. There is no evidence of complications such as pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.

Patient now s/p ICD placement. # Wide-complex tachycardia: SVT with abarrancy vs. sinus tachycardia. SVT less likely given failure to convert with adenosine. ECG on admission consistent with sinus tachycrdia + LBBB. Most likely this is tachycardia secondary to heart failure, pulmonary edema and possibly COPD exacerbation. Ischemia nevertheless should be ruled out given his history. Cardiac enzymes were trended to peak, at third set when CK and CKMB reached plateau. An ECHO was obtained that showed overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire posterior wall, and hypokinesis (with regional variation) of the rest of the left ventricle - basal segments relatively well-preserved. The patient then had a cardiac MRI to map out area of scar prior to EP study. He was then taken for an EP study where it became clear that this was indeed VT. However, there was difficulty finding focus with voltage map and was unable to induce VT. Pt kept having PVCs and may be coming from an epicardial focus. Therefore he was taken the next day to have an ICD placed. He was then started on a 3 day course of antibiotics. CXR after procedure showed leads in correct place and without complication. He was discharged the day after ICD placed. # Resp distress: CXR on admission consistent with pulmonary edema. Patient with known systolic CHF with LVEF = 40% per echo [**2121**]. Unclear trigger for decompensation. ? of contributing underlying COPD exacerbation +/- pneumonia (may have had aspiration during his dramatic intubation). The patient was intubated at OSH prior to admission. The patient was diueresed with lasix. The patient was successfully extubated on HOD 2. The patient's respiratory status remained well throughout the remainder of his hospitalization. # CHF: The patient had an EF of 40% in [**2121**]. ECHO on admission showed EF of 15%, likely secondary to myocardial stunning. He was given IV Furosamide 40mg x 2 on day of admission. Diueresed for a goal -1.5 to 2 L net negative until euvolemic. We continued to diurese pt until he was euvolemic. He was discharged on a regimen of 40 mg PO lasix. Repeat ECHO the day before discharge showed EF of 25%. The patient was started on BB and ACE-I. # CORONARIES: initially presented with CP, has history of Lcx instent restenosis in [**2121**]. Cardiac enzymes were initially trended and were initially elevated and trop up t 0.28 with elevated but flat CK and CKMB. However, the enzymes were hard to interpret given shocks. The patient was continued on home aspirin and started on metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. # Diabetes: The patient came in with a previous diagnosis of diabetes, however had not been taking his insulin for about 1 year. While in the hospital his glucose was trended and covered with ISS and long acting insulin adjusted accordingly. He was discharged on a regimen of 20 units of glargine in the AM. Diabetic education was provided prior to discharge. # Non-compliance: The patient has a h/o non-compliance and was only taking an aspirin prior to coming to the hospital. He reported insulin, but when re-evaluated he hadn't taken this in one year. Diabetic education was provided as well as it was stressed the importance of his new medications and following up with the scheduled appointments as well as establishing care with primary care doctor. Additionally social work met with the patient. He was set up with a home VNA prior to discharge to provide medication teaching, diabetes teaching, and education. # Alcohol Abuse: The patient had no signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal throughout the hospitalization. Education was provided and the patient was informed that it is strongly advised that he stop drinking. Transitional Issues: - The patient will need to establish with primary care doctor whom he reports he has never seen. He was instructed that it is very important for him to establish care. - Patient will need diabetes management optimized - Patient will follow up in device clinic and with cardiologist.

We do not feel that you had a heart attack. An electrophysiology study showed the rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. An internal cardiac defibrillator was placed that will shock you internally if this dangerous rhythm happens again. While you were here we worked to control your sugar level. We started you on a long acting insulin that you will take once a day. However, it is very important that you follow up with your primary care physician to get your diabetes under better control. Your heart is weaker after the shocks and you are at risk for fluid accumulation in your legs and lungs. Weigh yourself every morning, call your heart doctor if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days. An ICD (defibrilator) was placed. No baths or swimming for one week, no driving for one week until after you are seen in the device clinic. Do not lift your left arm or lift more than 5 pounds with your left arm for 6 weeks. It is extremely important that you quit drinking alcohol. This makes your heart weaker and works against the medicines that you are taking.

Service: NEUROSURGERY Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: headache Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**12-29**] left subdural hematoma evacuation [**2-4**] free latissimus flap scalp [**1-5**] stress MIBI [**1-12**] burr holes for subdural collection History of Present Illness: 85 y/o female with a history of squamous cell carcinoma resected from her forehead approximately 18 months ago. The patient did well following the procedure, and physicians were under the impression that the surgical margins were clean. Approximately 6 months ago she noted progressive difficulty with ambulation and over the past 2-3 weeks increasing headaches. She denies any falls or head trauma during this period,however,head CT obtained at an outside hospital reveals left frontal parietal chronic subdural hematoma approximately 1.7cm in thickness with 1.2cm midline shift. There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, but left frontal bone superior to the orbit is eroded with possible local invasion of carcinoma. Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for cranioplasty with free flap. Past Medical History: PMHx: atrial fib hypothyroidism CAD low back pain squamous cell carcinoma of the forehead Social History: Social Hx: denied tobacco, EtOH, or IVDU; she lived alone at home - retired Family History: Family Hx: noncontributory Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: Gen: Appears cachectic, unconscious, NAD. HEENT:Cerebral flap w/xeroform and gauze, depressed cranium Pupils: [**4-9**] bilaterally Neck: Supple. Lungs: CTA bilaterally. Cardiac: RRR. S1/S2. Abd: Soft, NT, BS+, NGT d/c'd [**2174-1-24**] Extrem: Warm and well-perfused. Neuro: Mental status: Unconscious, not following commands, no eye opening, spontaneous movement of all extremeties, BUE's contracted with extensive posturing to noxious stimuli. Orientation: UTA-unconscious Language: nonverbal Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 2 to 1.5mm bilaterally. III, IV, VI: not tested V, VII: not tested VIII: not tested IX, X: not tested [**Doctor First Name 81**]: not tested XII: not tested Motor: BUE's contracted, extend to noxious stimuli, BLE's with min w/d to deep noxious stimuli Pertinent Results: SCALP PATHOLOGY RESULTS: Clinical: 85 year old woman with metastatic tumor, frontal scalp involving skull and dura. The tumor from all five specimens shows similar features. Tumor cells are epithelioid, pleiomorphic and variably discohesive. Nuclei are enlarged and irregular and many are vesicular with prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are frequent. In the skin excision tumor is present in the dermis and extends to involve the deep subcutaneous tissue. An origin from the epidermis is not identified nor is there definitive morphologic evidence of squamous differentiation. Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor to be immunoreactive for vimentin. A large subpopulation of tumor cells are immunoreactive for cytokeratins as pankeratins (AE1/AE3/CAM 5.2), MNF 116 and focally for cytokeratin [**6-13**] and EMA, and to show strong nuclear reactivity for p63. There is variable reactivity in a subset of cells for CD138, CD31, CD68 and CD45. They are non-reactive for the melanocytic markers S-100, Mart-1, HMB-45, cytokeratins -7 and -20, CD79, CD34, Factor VIII, TTF-1 or the estrogen receptor. The morphologic features in conjunction with these immunohistochemical findings favor that this tumor is a poorly differentiated carcinoma. It may represent extension / recurrence of a tumor originally located at or near this site but a distant metastasis cannot be excluded. Correlation with the clinical findings is suggested. CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2174-1-18**] 11:09 AM Reason: f/u study [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 85 year old woman with s/p bifrontal craniectomy, in sicu REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: f/u study INDICATION: Status post bifrontal craniectomy, in CICU; assess interval change.

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted to neurosurgical ICU on [**2173-12-29**] for left frontal parietal chronic SDH with midline shift. There is also erosion to left orbit with possible local invasion of skin carcinoma. She was taken to the OR on HD#2 for evacuation of left subdural hematoma. She underwent the procedure and remained intubated until POD#2. Her mental status improved after the surgery. She self d/c'd NGT on [**1-1**]; she passed bedside swallow evaluation on [**1-2**] and her PO diet was resumed. She underwent latissimus flap cranioplasty by plastic services on [**2174-1-5**] and she tolerated the procedure well with no complications. Postoperatively she was transfered back to the ICU intubated with 1 penrose, 2 JP drains, xeroform over the donor skin graft site, and xeroform over the flap. She was extubated on [**2174-1-7**] without difficulty. She slowly improved to the ability to follow commands and open eyes to voice. Plastic services continued to follow her throughout her hospitalization. She was evaluated by speech and swallowing on [**1-11**] and was recommended NPO until further re-eval. On [**1-12**] the patient became less responsive and less able to follow commands. Repeat Head CT showed left frontal infarct/increasing SDH with increased midline shift. She was taken back to the OR for a craniotomy for evacuation of SDH. She stayed in ICU postop and was extubated on [**1-13**]. Neurologically she opens eyes spontaneously, but following commands inconsistently. She has mild weakness with RUE and [**6-12**] with LUE; she moves both LE antigravity. Repeat CTH [**1-16**] with slight worse L SDH, and stable on CTH [**1-18**]. She was transferred out of ICU to stepdown on [**2174-1-19**] and was started with PT and chest PT. Patient's mental status slowly deteriorated to more somnolence, not open eyes and inconsistently following commands. She was tachypneic sometimes with O2 sat maintained in 90s on humidified room air. CXRs are negative for pneumonia; her breathing pattern improved with atrovent inhalor and expectant guaifenesin. **************** Family meeting took place on [**1-24**],at which point the decision was to refocus care towards comfort measures only.

Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Diltiazem / Demerol Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath. Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization History of Present Illness: EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: (per HPI) "84 year old woman with known CAD (s/p BMS to RCA x 2 in '[**44**], DES to LAD [**2-11**]), systolic HF (EF 45%), PVD (s/p bilateral LE bypass,) HTN, RAS, PAF, who presented to an outside hospital w/ sudden onset of SOB. Patient awoke in middle of night w/ difficulty breathing. When EMS arrived, she was found to be hypoxic to 84%. She was initially admitted to the ICU for CPAP, but with a significant symptomatic improvement to lasix, she was able to have oxygen titrated down to NC. She denies any ensuing CP prior to the episode and had no palpitations. She denies any recent LE swelling, premonitory SOB, or lightheadedness. Patient had a recent hospitalization 2 weeks prior to presentation. At that time she ruled out for MI, and was discharged following adjustments to medication. Patient underwent a pharm neuclear stress test, which was nondiagnostic on EKG, with failure to show changes in baseline sinus bradycardia. There is no report in the transfer records of elevated cardiac enzymes. Per report, nuclear imaging showed nuclear mixed inferior defect. Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization." . Oon [**2150-11-11**], pt underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed ISRS and she had 2 DES to the LAD placed. She did well post-cath and received renal protection via bicarb and mucomyst. Her volume status remained tenuous and she was aggressively diuresed. However, her renal function also began to decline, raising concern for overdiuresis. Her room air sats remained low, though, so her outpatient lasix dose was resumed. Today, she was given her AM dose of lasix, but her afternoon dose was held because of her rising creatinine and her euvolemic status. However, in the evening, the patient began to complain of respiratory distress. Her SBP were found to be in the 160s-170s. She was given: 60mg IV lasix (with minimal UOP), 4mg IV morphine total, and nitroglycerin gtt at 1.4mcg/kg/min. Sats were 78% on 3-4L -> improved only to 90-92% on NRB. She was given an additional dose of 120mg lasix IV with minimal UOP. An ABG showed pH 7.18, pCO2 95, and pO2 94. Decision was made to attempt BiPAP but that was unable to be performed on the floor. The patient was minimally responsive and was using accessory muscles of respiration. The decision was made to intubate her for airway protection and control. She was intubated easily (with etom/succ) and brought to the CCU for further management. EKG performed on arrival to the SICU were concerning for ST elevations in the precordial leads, but they resolved somewhat with time so the decision was made to follow her enzymes and not go to cath urgently. She remained on heparin IV overnight for possible ACS as her troponins were elevated (but her CK was flat). Past Medical History: -CAD -> multivessel s/p 2 complex angioplasties of RCA; [**2-6**] she underwent PTCA/stenting of the mid/distal RCA; [**9-8**] LMCA had a mild proximal stenosis, LAD had a 60% proximal stenosis at D1. The remainder of the vessel had mild-moderate diffuse disease. . -The circumflex system was small with a 40% focal OM1 lesion. The RCA had a 20% proximal stenosis. There were serial 90% and 80% focal in-stent restenotic lesions of the mid and distal vessel. The PDA filled via collaterals from the left. Successful PTCA of the RCA was performed using a 3.0x15 mm cutting balloon proximally and a 2.5x15 mm cutting balloon distally. There was 20% residual stenosis in the mid-RCA and 10% distally with normal flow and no apparent dissection. . -DES to LAD in [**2-11**] --CHF - h/o recurrent admissions for CHF exacerbations; cath [**2144**] showed elevated filling pressures but normal EF.

Unchanged mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. . . CARDIAC CATH [**2151-11-17**] . BRIEF HISTORY: Patient is a 84 year old woman with CAD, CRI, DM, PVD with stenting to LAD 5 days ago for in-stent restenosis in the setting of pulmonary edema which is her anginal equivalent. She had two Taxus stents 2.5x24 and 2.75x12 overlapping placed into the LAD. She now presents again with CHF and had to be briefly intubated. Her troponin rose and was thought to initially be demand but when CK rose to 500's and echo showed anterior wall motion abnormality today, stent thrombosis in the LAD became a concern. EKG with LBBB which had been present intermittently in past. Patient was taken emergently to cath lab to exclude sub-acute stent thrombosis. . PTCA COMMENTS: Initial angiography revealed an occlusion of the mid LAD at the distal edge of the recently placed Taxus stent consistent with stent thrombosis. We planned to treat this lesion with PTCA and stenting. Heparin and integrelin were started in addition to asa and plavix. A 6F XBLAD guide provided good support for the procedure. A PT graphix wire crossed the lesion without difficulty. We Dottered through the lesion and re-established flow. A Voyager 2x15mm balloon was inflated at 8 atm and the lesion was stented with a 2.5x12 mm Vision stent at 18atm. The stent was post-dilated with a Highsail 2.75x8mm balloon at 26atm. Final angiography revealed no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 2 flow. Patient left the cath lab in stable condition. . COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography of the left system revealed occlusion of the recently stented LAD. The LMCA, LCX and their branches were unchanged from cath 5 days ago. The RCA was not engaged. 2. Limited hemodynamics revealed systemic blood pressure of 125/49 with HR of 56. 3. Successful treatment of mid LAD stent thrombosis with Vision 2.5x12mm stent. Final angiography revealed TIMI 2 flow. . FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Single vessel CAD with stent thrombosis of the LAD 2. Successful recanalization of LAD and stenting with Vision bare metal stent. .

PTCA COMMENTS: Initial angiography revealed a 90% mid LAD ISR and 70% disease just distal to the prior stent. We planned to treat this lesion with ptca and stenting. Heparin was started prophylactically for the procedure. An xblad guiding catheter provided adequate support for the procedure. The lesion was crossed with a prowater wire with minimal difficulty. The lesion was dilated with a 2.0x15mm voyager balloon at 10 atm and then at 12 atm. A 2.5x24mm taxus stent was ythen deployed in the distal stenosis at 6 atm., A 2.75x12mm taxus stent was then deployed overlapping the proximal edge of the just-placed stent and within the previously stented region at 18 atm. The stents were postdilated with a 2.5x20mm nc [**Male First Name (un) **] balloon at 18 atm, 22 and then at 24 atm sequentially. Final angiography revealed o% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow. The patient left the lab free of angina and in stable condition. . COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had moderate diffuse disease, was moderately calcified, and had a distal taper of 40%. The LAD had a 40% stenosis at its origin. The previously placed stent had 90% in-stent restenosis. There was distal LAD had a 90% stenosis. The LCx was a nondominant vessel without critical lesions. There is a mid-segment 40% lesion unchanged from the previous angiograpm. The RCA was the dominant vessel with a previously placed and widely patent stent. The previous 60% stenosis in now 40%. There is diffuse PLB disease that was unchanged from previous angiography. 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal right sided filling pressures. The RVEDP wa 12 mmHg. There was pulmonary arterial hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 53/16/31 (systolic/diastolic/mean in mmHg). LVEDP was 16 mmHg. There were no gradients across the [**Male First Name (un) **], pulmonary, mitral, or aortic valves. 3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with overlapping 2.5x24mm taxus and 2.75x12mm taxus both post dilated to 2.5mm. Final angiography revealed o% resiudal stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow (see ptca comments). . FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. .

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 38291**] was an 84 y/o woman admitted for a CHF exacerbation, anginal equivalent. She went to cardiac cath on [**11-11**], was found to have 90% instent restenosis of her LAD and 90% stenosis just distal to the end of the stent. Two overlapping Taxus stents were placed at this time. Patient returned to the floor. She was noted to have a creatinine rise at this time. She developed volume overload and went into flash pulmonary edema on the floor. She was emergently intubated on [**2151-11-15**]. She at this time had no urine output to 60mg IV lasix. She then put out to 120mg IV lasix and diuril. Patient was noted to have a new LBBB at this time. Pt was noted to have an enzyme leak at this time, but her troponins were flat for the next day. The following day [**11-15**] she was extubated. She at that time developed shortness of breath and her enzymes trended up. She was taken back to the cardiac cath lab where she was noted to have an sub-acute thrombosus of at the distal margin of her recently placed LAD taxus stent. PTCA was done and a bare metal stent was placed. A repeat transthoracic echo was showed a LVEF of 25%, with global hypokinesis, a change from patients [**2-11**] echo. . At this time patient was noted to be in fluid overload. She had a left sided pleural effusion and an increasing oxygen requirement. On [**11-18**] a thoracentesis was done to help reduce oxygen requirement. . Patient had received two dye loads in one week. She at this time was making urine, but not putting out substantially to her lasix. A lasix drip was started. At this time the patient developed acute renal failure. Her Cr had climbed from 2.0 (1.3 on admit) to Cr 4.0. Patient was not responding well to diuril or lasix. The renal service was consulted to evaluate for CVVH. CVVH was considered and on the day prior to death, it was felt that clinically the patient could wait another day before starting dialysis. . Around this time metoprolol was stopped as patient was considered to be in an acute systolic CHF exacerbation. She was also started on Milrinone to help forward flow, in the hopes that it would aide in kidney perfusion and lead to better diuresis. . In the early morning of [**11-21**]. Patient reported sudden onset of shortness of breath. An ECG was done which showed no change from prior. Patients vitals were stable. She was slightly tachycardic, but normotensive. Patients oxygen requirements had not changed and on physical exam her lungs sounded clearer than earlier in the day. She was given IV morphine, started on a nitro drip and her milrinone was discontinued. Patients shortness of breath was relieved by this regimen. . Starting 4 hours prior to this the patient stopped making urine. She was not responding to lasix at this time. The patient's vitals were at this time stable. Normal heart rate, normotensive, normal RR, above 90% oxygen saturations. She was breathing with out distress and denied any more sensation of chest pain or dyspnea. The team felt that there was no need to consult for urgent dialysis. Renal had evaluated the patient only 7 hours prior and felt CVVH was not needed. Plans were in place for renal to reevaluate for CVVH first thing in the morning. . At 3AM, the housestaff was notified by nursing that the patient had passed away. There was no change in vitals or further complaints by patient prior to passing. Telemetry showed the patient went from normal sinus rhythm straight into asystole. The patient had been made DNR/DNI two days prior to this episode, so no code was called. . The attending physician and next of [**Doctor First Name **] were notified. PCP was later notified. Patient's daughter who was the healthcare proxy was offered and refused an autopsy. The primary cause of death was considered to be coronary artery disease. The immediate cause was unknown as there was no post-mortem. It was hypothesized that the cause of death was from a very sudden etiology such as acute thrombosus of her LAD, pulmonary embolism or another condition leading to a possible PEA cardiopulmonary arrest. This is however only speculation. Pt was never witnessed to be in PEA. .

In [**2127-2-25**], she had an intracatheterization MI (clotted off LAD, LCX on [**2127-3-24**]) with cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitaiton requiring ECMO. Kissing stents of the LMCA into the LAD and Lcx were deployed. The patient course was complicated by RP bleed. Her last echo ([**2127-3-28**]) shows LVEF 30% with LV basal and mid inferior hypokinesis with basal and mid inferolateral and lateral akinesis. . The patient most recent hospitalization was [**7-17**] -[**7-24**]. During which time she had CHF symptoms and found to have an increase PA pressure. The patient was started on Amiodarone and instructed to restart Toprol. . Current hospitalization Pt was in usual state of health until day of admission when she took first doses of Toprol XL (25mg) (~2PM). She began to complain of DOE and headache and presented to the ED ~11PM on day of admission. . EMS found HR to be in 50s, BP 70s/palp. In ED was given fluids, and began to feel slightly better. Admitted to OBS. Patient then began to brady down to 40s in junctional rhythm ultimately requiring Atropine, then Epinephrine and transcutaneous pacing as well as a second liter of fluid. Cardiology consult was called and at the time of arrival, patient had been intubated for airway protection given continued bradycardia and hypotension. Dopamine was started with minimal effect. During evaluation, patient went into PEA and was given epinephrine 1mg with good effect, and pulse was reestablished. Dopamine was run wide-open. Following initial stabilization, patient returned to PEA, and ACLS/CPR was initiated. Patient continued to receive epinephrine up to a total dose of 5mg as well as glucagon, at which point she was again stabilized on dopamine drip 20mcg. STAT Echocardiogram following stabilization revealed: No effusion, mild RV hypokinesis, good LV function, 2+MR. Once the patient stabilized she was tx to the CCU.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with focal akinesis/thinning of the basal 2/3rds of the inferolateral and inferior walls. The remaining segments contract well. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe hypokinesis of the apical 2/3rds of the free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but with good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. ?Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (focused views). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. . ECG [**2127-7-31**] Junctional mechanism at rate 52 with marked Q-T interval prolongation and anterolateral T wave inversion. Consider drug effect, primary CNS pathology and/or myocardial ischemia. Also noted is right axis deviation. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-4-15**] the mechanism is junctional rather than sinus, the rate is slower, Q-T interval prolongation (borderline on the prior tracing) is now marked, and there is new T wave inversion in leads V2-V5. T waves are inverted in leads I, aVL and V6 on both tracings. . ECG [**2127-8-1**] Compared to the previous tracing the rhythm is now sinus bradycardia at rate 51 rather than junctional at rate 52. Q-T interval prolongation and precordial and lateral T wave inversions persist. The differential is as before. . ECG [**2127-8-4**] Sinus rhythm Consider left atrial abnormality Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure Consider right ventricular overload Nonspecific T wave abnormalities Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2127-8-3**], no significant change Brief Hospital Course: Course in the ED EMS found HR to be in 50s, BP 70s/palp. In ED was given fluids, and began to feel slightly better. Admitted to OBS. Patient then began to brady down to 40s in junctional rhythm ultimately requiring Atropine, then Epinephrine and transcutaneous pacing as well as a second liter of fluid.

STAT Echocardiogram following stabilization revealed: No effusion, mild RV hypokinesis, good LV function, 2+MR. The patient was transferred to the CCU and her course was as follows: 1. Cor: The patient has a hx of CAD s/p kissing stents of LAD/LCX. The patient was maintained on aspirin and plavix. The BB and amiiodarone were initially held. The BB was later restarted. 2. Rhythm: The etiology of the patient's PEA was unknown. During the initial part of her course she was in a junctional rhythm and hypotensive. An atrial pacer was placed and the patient remained in NSR and her BP improved. The patient was later weaned off of the dopa gtt and the pacer was removed. Her BB and Amiodarone were held as this may have contributed to her PEA. It was later felt that the patient's presentation was secondary to the amiodarone. The patient was restarted on lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **]. Amiodarone has since been listed as one of her allergies. 3. Pump: During the code, an emergency ECHO was performed. No pericardial effusion was noted. The patient's EF was 35-40%. The final report was significant for the following: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with focal akinesis/thinning of the basal 2/3rds of the inferolateral and inferior walls. The remaining segments contract well. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe hypokinesis of the apical 2/3rds of the free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but with good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. ?Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (focused views). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. After reviewing the ECHO , the patient's cardiologist recommended MV repair. However the patient refused. 4. Airway protection: The patient was intubated strictly for airway protection. She was later extubated once deemed medically stable. Her O2 sats were stable on room air. 5. ARF: Creatinine increased from 1.2 to 1.4 within 48 hours. This was attributed to ATN (ischemic assault). Her creatinine was monitored. Her FeNa was 0.6, suggestive of a prerenal azotemia. PO fluids were encouraged. 6. Dispo: The patient was discharged home with services and scheduled to followup with her cadiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], and her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. On POD 1 the patient did have a seizure and neurology was consulted. Dilantin was started. The patient likely had a CVA per neurology. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. He developed atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was started. He did become drowsy after a dose of Ativan and required BIPAP at night. He made further progress and was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery on POD 4. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. Repeat brain MRI showed No evidence of acute infarct, moderate-to-severe atrophy and small vessel disease.

ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to Effexor, Penicillin and Topamax. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone, occasionally drinks alcohol and has a significant smoking history, however, she quit six years ago. FAMILY HISTORY: Her father has diabetes and had an myocardial infarction. Mother had an myocardial infarction. Brother had an myocardial infarction. Negative for cancer. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 212**] MEDICINE SERVICE: Temperature 97.7. Heart rate 85. Blood pressure 92/palpable. Respiratory rate 18. O2 sat 100% on 4 liters. General the patient appears comfortable and in no acute distress. Neck 8 cm JVD. Positive hepatojugular reflex. Chest clear at apices. Decreased breath sounds at right base. Coarse crackles half way up bilaterally. Heart irregular, clicking noises when resolved when holding breath. Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdomen positive bowel sounds, all quadrants, soft, nontender, nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally, trace edema, cool extremities, no cyanosis, Pneumoboots in place. PERTINENT LABORATORIES/X-RAYS/EKGS AND OTHER TESTS: On [**2127-7-15**] hematocrit was 23.0. On [**2127-7-15**] the patient was ruled out for an myocardial infarction. Her CKs were 86, 112, 89, troponin was 0.18, 0.2, 0.14. Swab taken [**2127-7-12**] from right chest tube site revealed 1+ polys on gram stain, carinii bacteria and coag negative staph with two colonial morphologies. Chest x-ray on [**2127-7-21**] showed no evidence of cardiac failure, multiple right sided rib fractures, soft tissue thickening consistent with stable versus resolved hematoma, loculated right pleural effusion with atelectasis at right base, no pneumothorax, left lung is well aerated. HOSPITAL COURSE: On the early morning of [**2127-7-15**] the patient was transferred from the surgery service to the trauma CICU for increased respiratory stress and agitation. Her O2 sats dropped to 70% when not on O2, but improved to 100% on 4 liters by face mask. She was also found to be hypercarbic on blood gas. She was confused, tachycardic and tachypneic. A chest x-ray showed no changes with no congestive heart failure and no pneumothorax. A Foley was placed and an A line was placed for access for repeated arterial blood gas. She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 23.0 on [**7-15**]. She also was ruled out for an myocardial infarction. Her CKs and troponins increased slightly, however, this was not felt to be consistent with a myocardial infarction. On [**7-16**] she was started on a beta blocker, Captopril and aspirin. Her neurological examination fluctuated from being calm to restless and agitated. A CTE was performed revealing prior anterior septal and apical akinesis with global hypokinesis and an EF of 25 to 30%. On [**7-17**] she was transferred to the MICU. She demonstrated evidence of decompensated heart failure and had hypotension to systolic blood pressures of 70 with codeine. She showed she was very sensitive to Captopril and beta blockers and subsequently dropped her systolic blood pressures and required several boluses of intravenous fluids. On [**7-18**] she was transferred to the regular medical floor and her beta blockers and ace inhibitors were held given her history of hypotension. She was diuresed with Lasix, which improved her O2 requirements and her tachypnea. On [**7-19**] she demonstrated an elevated white blood cell count from 12 to 19 and underwent a repeat chest x-ray, repeat blood culture and urinalysis and urine culture. Her chest x-ray showed no change from previously seen right loculated effusion and showed no evidence of congestive heart failure. Her urine culture showed 10 to 100,000 yeast. Her blood cultures are negative to date. On [**7-21**] the patient remained afebrile and continued to clinically improve. Her O2 requirements decreased to 2 and then 1 liter of oxygen by nasal cannula. She was seen by physical therapy who felt she needed further rehab. They recommended she needed ability training, therapeutic exercises and monitoring of her pulmonary status. On [**7-22**] she continued to clinically improve. Her breathing was subjectively improving. She received a bed at the [**Hospital 533**] Rehab. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Fair. DISCHARGE STATUS: To rehab facility. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right rib fractures status post chest tube insertions times two. 2. Urinary tract infection. 3. Right lower lobe pneumonia. 4. Loculated pleural effusion. 5. Anemia. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.

Service: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 66 year old female admitted on [**2127-7-11**], mid afternoon, four days after discharge from the Thrombus Service where she had had a right pneumothorax and right-sided rib fractures due to a motor vehicle accident. At that time she had been discharged to a rehabilitation facility, primarily due to her social situation where she was considered to a fall risk and she lives at home alone without any social support. One day prior to admission, staff at the skilled nursing facility noticed increased drainage from the chest tube wound sight and today the patient was noted to have a temperature of 101.6. The patient has also noticed worsening shortness of breath. She was transported back to [**Hospital6 649**] and admitted back to the Trauma Service. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Status post motor vehicle crash ten days prior with multiple right rib fractures, status post right-sided chest tube, glaucoma, chronic neuritic pain, depression and otherwise nonspecified psychiatric history, most likely a paranoid personality disorder. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post left open reduction and internal fixation of the tibial plateau and status post bilateral hip replacement. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Timolol, eye drops for glaucoma, Nortriptyline 75 mg q.d., Neurontin 600 mg t.i.d., Colace, Celexa 10 mg q.d., Percocet prn and Ibuprofen. ALLERGIES: The patient has stated allergies to Effexor, Penicillin and Topamax, none of which were related to rash or shortness of breath by her history. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on arrival showed temperature 97.6, heartrate 98, blood pressure 145/37 and respiratory rate 18. Oxygen saturations were 82% on room air and 99% on nonrebreather. The patient was awake and alert in no acute distress, not tachypneic. There was a right-sided chest crepitus palpated and auscultated. Left side of the lung, decreased breathsounds as well at the base. There was no jugulovenous distension. Heart had a regular rate. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and had good bowel sounds. The left knee had an area of ecchymosis but was not tender to palpation nor warm to the touch. Left eye also had some ecchymosis from a prior hematoma on the left anterior portion of her scalp. LABORATORY DATA: Initial laboratory data were significant for a white count of 19.8, hematocrit 28, the patient having a baseline hematocrit at discharge between 28 and 30. Urinalysis with numerous white blood cells. Initial radiology, chest x-ray was obtained showing left lower lobe and right lower lobe consolidation, as well as a right lower lobe effusion. Electrocardiogram was performed which showed no acute change from her prior electrocardiogram. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the floor for possible empyema versus pneumonia versus urinary tract infection and started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. It was difficult to maintain the patient's oxygenation due to her pain. A chest tube was attempted to be placed but was placed in the chest wall and not in the intrapleural space. Said chest tube was discontinued and upon thoracic surgery consultation was not felt to be needed. The chest computerized tomographic angiography was required to rule out pulmonary embolism which showed the patient to be without emboli. Chest computerized tomography scan did reveal a small right apical pneumothorax as well as a small right hydropneumothorax near the pulmonary artery and atelectasis versus pneumonia at the right middle lobe. Aggressive chest physical therapy and antibiotics gradually improved the patient's oxygenation until she was sating well on simple nasal cannula. Antibiotics were switched over to Levaquin and as her condition has improved, she is stable for transfer back to the rehabilitation facility where it is crucial that she use incentive spirometry, has gotten out of bed as often as possible and that her pain is managed well to prevent relapse of possible pneumonia. She should follow up at the Trauma Clinic in one to two weeks and should have an outpatient colonoscopy scheduled as she has a persistent anemia with heme positive stools. After she is done completing her course of Fluoroquinolones it is recommended that she be started on iron therapy but not prior to finishing her Levaquin as Fluoroquinolone levels are reduced in the face of concurrent iron therapy. At this time the patient is discharged with the following diagnoses. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Right rib fractures from prior motor vehicle accident status post second chest tube insertion 2. Urinary tract infection 3. Pneumonia 4. Loculated hydropneumothoraces on the right times two 5. Anemia DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Nortriptyline 75 mg h.s. 2. Neurontin 600 mg t.i.d. 3. Docusate 100 mg b.i.d. 4. Celexa 10 mg q.d. 5. Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o. q. 6 hours prn for ten days 6. Levaquin 500 mg q.d. for nine days DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Chest physiotherapy one to two times per day as well as physical therapy for general strengthening and gait safety. It is expected that as her condition improves she will be safe to be discharged back home.

The patient was begun vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl empirically and underwent vein mapping of the upper extremities to determine the adequacy of conduit. A Duplex was done of graft which showed a patent graft femoral dorsalis pedis on the right. The patient had both right and left lesser saphenous veins, and greater saphenous veins were absent. Arm veins (both basilic and cephalic) were patent. The patient underwent an arteriogram on [**2136-12-31**] which demonstrated a patent aorta and bilateral common external and internal iliac arteries. The right lower leg runoff showed patent common femoral artery, superficial femoral artery, and profunda femoris. There was a patent popliteal with mild (less than 50%) stenosis of the above-knee popliteal just above the joint. There were extremely calcified tibial vessels. The patient had a patent anterior tibial and a patent tibial peroneal trunk. There was a focal occlusion at the origin of the peroneal which reconstructed. There was an occlusion at the origin of the posterior tibialis with a diseased vessel distally. The anterior tibial and posterior tibialis were occluded. The anterior tibial reconstructed and occluded at the ankle. The peroneal was with multiple areas of mild stenosis. The dorsalis pedis was calcified which reconstructed at the ankle and bifurcated into the tarsals. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (a cardiologist) evaluated the patient for perioperative risk assessment. The patient underwent a Persantine MIBI which demonstrated the patient's stress portion of the Persantine MIBI was negative for electrocardiogram or anginal symptoms. The nuclear portion demonstrated the ventricular cavity was dilated both in stress and at rest. Both stress and resting images showed no definite perfusion defects. The ejection fraction was calculated at 37%. There was severe global hypokinesis. The patient was assessed as a class III for surgery; at an increased risk, but there was no obvious ischemia on the Persantine MIBI, and the patient was considered safe to proceed with surgery but to continue all of his current medications. On [**2137-1-2**] the patient underwent a left below-knee popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass with reversed lesser saphenous vein. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient required 200 cc of packed red blood cells intraoperatively. The patient was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit intubated. Postoperatively, there were no significant electrocardiogram changes. An echocardiogram was done which revealed no significant effusions or evidence of tamponade; although there was diminished left ventricular function, but this was unchanged from a preoperative echocardiogram, and the right ventricle did not appear dilated and was normal. Intraoperatively, the patient coded. The patient suffered a transient ischemic attack. Epinephrine was given and continued resuscitation with return of a bounding pulse with good normalization of his end-tidal carbon dioxide. Total cardiopulmonary resuscitation times was estimated to be one minute. The patient was transferred with a systolic blood pressure of 200/110 and a heart rate of 120. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure had been 60 to 80. It was noted to be 100. Esmolol 20 mg times two and nitroglycerin 120 mcg doses reduced the heart rate and blood pressure with a resultant heart rate of 90 and a systolic blood pressure of 170/80; respectively. The patient was transported to the Postanesthesia Care Unit intubated. He required dopamine during transport. On arrival to the Postanesthesia Care Unit, vital signs were recorded. The arterial line showed a blood pressure of 125/55, heart rate 89, and the oxygen saturation was on 100% positive airway pressure was 6925, central venous pressure was 11.

PHYSICAL EXAM: She is afebrile, pulse 72, BP 130/70, respirations 24, O2 sat 94% on room air, 5'3", weighs 210 pounds. She is alert and oriented x 3 in no apparent distress. Her heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. Lungs have scattered crackles which are greater on the left side. Her abdomen is obese but soft with bowel sounds. She is nontender, nondistended. She is guaiac negative. She has slightly palpable pulses with capillary refill less than 2 seconds. LABORATORY VALUES: White blood cell count 9.7, hematocrit 27.4, platelets 185, sodium 147, potassium 4.4, chloride 104, bicarb 24, BUN 81, creatinine 5.7, glucose 163, PT 13.5, PTT 25.4, INR 1.2. Her urinalysis was negative. She is CMV negative and EBV negative. Her EKG showed no ischemic changes. A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary failure with bilateral pleural effusions, left side greater than the right side. Stress test, per the patient, was within normal limits. HOSPITAL COURSE: So, the patient was admitted to transplant surgery. She was consented for a transplant, and she was brought to the operating room. In the operating room, the patient received immunosuppression with ATG, thymoglobulin 125 mg, Solu-Medrol IV 500 mg, and CellCept 1 gm IV. She also received antibiotic prophylaxis with Unasyn and Diflucan. The ATG was continued for 3 days, and the Solu-Medrol was gradually tapered down to 20 mg qd by the time the patient was discharged, and the CellCept was continued at 1 mg qd. She is also on antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of her discharge with bactrim, Valcyte, and oral nystatin qid. Ms. [**Known lastname 97656**] transplanted kidney began functioning very well almost immediately, and by postoperative day #6, the patient's creatinine was down to 1.3. She has been making good urine. An ultrasound of the transplanted kidney on postoperative day #1 showed no perinephric collections, and normal arterial and venous blood flow with normal resistive indices. Postoperatively, the patient's pain control issues were monitored with opiates, and she will go home on percocet. On postoperative day #5, the patient complained of fluid leakage from the inferior portion of her abdominal wound. Several of the inferior staples were removed from her wound, and a gush of serosanguineous fluid was expelled. This was sent for culture and followed with wet-to-dry dressing changes q shift. There were no signs of infection about this seroma site, and the patient's fascial layer underneath was intact. CARDIOVASCULAR: On postop day #2, the patient was started on her hypertensive medicines, and her blood pressure has been under good control since admission. RESPIRATORY: She has had no issues. GI: Soon after the surgery, she began tolerating a PO diet and was slowly advanced to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diabetic diet which she tolerated well without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. RENAL: The patient did postoperatively start making urine, and her creatinine dropped, as was previously mentioned. She also did suffer some electrolyte abnormalities, hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Finally, the patient's last major issue is her mobility. The patient's ability to move around is hampered by her weight and her chronic leg weakness. Her weakness and pain in her legs is exacerbated by the hypervolemic state following surgery, and she has been held in the hospital for several days now awaiting placement in an appropriate rehab facility. Therefore, the patient is being discharged today, on [**9-12**], with the following diagnoses on the following medications: DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Tacrolimus 4 mg po bid. 2.

Marked diffuse small-bowel dilatation with extensive pneumatosis, air in mesenteric vessels, and portal venous air consistent with ischemic bowel and concerning for bowel infarction. Note: study is limited by lack of IV contrast, and therefore an embolic or thrombotic event to a mesenteric vessel cannot be excluded, particularly given evidence of extensive background vascular disease. 2. At least two sub 5 mm pulmonary nodules seen in the right lower lobe. In the absence of malignancy, one-year follow up would be recommended to document stability. Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Resuscitation was initiated and a central line placed. The CT findings concerning for ischemic bowel were discussed with the patient and her family and non-operative intervention was decided upon despite a discussion of the likely mortality of her condition. She remained with supportive treatment overnight with IV antibiotics, IV hydration, and NGT decompression. Discussions regarding her condition and prognosis were again held with the patient and her family and at this point operative intervention was agreed upon. The patient was taken to the operating room and an exploratory laparotomy perfomed. Please see operative dictation for details. She was found to have a necrotic, non-viable small bowel too extensive for resection. She was taken back to the surgical ICU and discussions were held with the patient and her family.

Though the pt satted well and had improved abg's on NRB and then high flow mask, the underlying pathophysiology--her CHF and likely pna--did not appear improved. 2) Poor cardiac output--The has had a hx of declining mentation over the past few weeks that has fallen precipitously leading to this admit. Also, during this admit, the pt's Cr has elevated significantly and her urine output has fallen. This is likely due to worsening cardiac out-put.

By CXR, and the patient??????s history, CHF was a likely a component to her presentation. However, the pt showed no response to a bolus of lasix IV as well as lasix drip. Also, per nursing staff, the pt had not been mentating well and had had difficulty taking PO and may have aspirated. O/N pt developed a fever over empiric levo/flagyl. Though the pt satted well and had improved abg's on NRB, then high flow mask, the underlying pathophysiology--her CHF and low cardiac output as well as her likely pna--did not appear improved. By [**2165-8-21**] the pt had made little urine out-put and , thus, appeared to remain volume overloaded pulmonary-wise. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the cardiology fellow, low dose peripheral dobutamine was atarted in hopes of improving cardiac output. However, the urine output remained low and the pt??????s BP dropped to around 60/30. The pt??????s temp spiked as well to around 103 F. Thus, the picture was complicated by sepsis. 2) Poor cardiac output??????Before admission the pt had a hx of declining mentation over the past few weeks that has fallen precipitously leading to this admit. Also, during this admit, the pt's Cr has elevated significantly and her urine output has fallen. This was likely due to worsening cardiac out-put. It is unclear what the precipitating event was that led to the acute decompensation of her cardiac output. On [**8-21**] her CO was unresponsive to dobutamine and her BP was worsening by its effects. This likely led to the pulmonary effects described above. 3) Low [**Name (NI) 49810**] pt's BP worsened with the dobutamine. During the administration of the dopamine, she was found to have a temp to 103. The pt's BP did not recover despite the dobutamine being stopped and levophed being administered and escalated to the maximum dose. Eventually levophed was added with minimal effect. The pt was deemed to be septic. 4) Code status: [**Name (NI) 49811**] pt's cardiogenic shock exacerbated by an apparent underlying septic shock was discussed with the family. The pt's family was updated as to her condition throughout her admission. With no improvement in the pt's MAPs despite escalating doses of levophed, the pt??????s son, Dr. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (hcp) felt the goals of care should be to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].

In general, she is a cachectic female, frail appearing. HEENT: Pupils were nonreactive. Mucous membranes were dry. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy. Heart is regular rate and rhythm with III/VI harsh systolic murmur, loudest at the left lower sternal border. Lungs were coarse breath sounds bilaterally. Extremities showed left lower extremity discolored and warm with desquamation to upper shin. No frank ulcerations, no edema. One plus pedal pulses. The abdomen was soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly. LABORATORY: On admission, white blood cell count 7.1, hematocrit 40, platelets 420. Chem-7 was within normal limits. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a left axis. No acute ST-T changes. Decreased voltage in the inferolateral leads. T waves flatter in the lateral lead. Chest x-ray after intubation showed expansion of the left lower lobe with endotracheal tube 3 to 4 centimeters above the carina. Increased pulmonary vascular congestion. HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: 1. CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient was admitted with ST depressions in V4 and V5 with a slight troponin leak, likely attributed to demand ischemia in the setting of low blood pressure. She had no intervention and was continued on aspirin. PUMP - The patient with an ejection fraction of 15% with two plus mitral regurgitation and two plus tricuspid regurgitation, slightly congestive heart failure on chest x-ray. She was diuresed some in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was called out and was not diuresed any further. Intravenous were continued secondary to hypoxia. RHYTHM: The patient with ventricular tachycardia arrest and status post DC cardioversion in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, was now stable in atrial fibrillation. Did have one episode of ventricular tachycardia on the floor which resolved with administration of Lopressor. The patient was continued on Telemetry. 2. PULMONARY: The patient with hypoxia likely secondary to pneumonia and left lower lobe atelectasis, and large bilateral pleural effusions. The patient never had a pulmonary embolism work-up, however, the family opted for non-aggressive measures. 3. PNEUMONIA: The patient had gram negative rods, likely stems from pneumonia and Enterobacter. The Enterobacter is pan sensitive. The patient was on Ceptaz for the gram negative rod effusions, bilateral layering and opted not to tap. 4. GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient with an episode of coffee ground emesis with stable hematocrits. No further intervention was taken on this. 5. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Pneumonia as above. Urinary tract infection with yeast; unclear is this is infection on positive urinalysis. Was never treated with Diflucan. 6. INTEGUMENT: Was continued on antibiotics for cellulitis. The patient was on the floor in respiratory distress since she was called out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit and on the 28th, it was decided to make the patient COMFORT MEASURES ONLY. On the morning of [**1-15**], the patient was found unresponsive to voice and pain without carotid pulses or heart sounds. Time of Death was 07:55 a.m. Attending, primary care physician and family were notified and no postmortem examination was requested. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Pneumonia. 2. Cellulitis. 3. Respiratory failure. 4. Hypotension. 5. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. 6. Upper gastrointestinal bleed. 7. Ventricular tachycardia arrest. 8. Congestive heart failure. 9. Urinary tract infection. 10. Hypoxia.

Service: NEUROLOGY Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: acute onset left-sided weakness, dysarthria and confusion with concern for stroke. Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement History of Present Illness: 80F with a past history of AF not on warfarin, CADs/p MI, HTN, HLD presents with acute onset left-sided weakness, dysarthria and confusion with concern for stroke. Patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] yesterday and details of her hospitalisation are currently unknown. History was not possible from the patient due to confusion, drowsiness and inattention. Patient was apparently last seen well between 08:15 and at roughly 08:30 at the nursing home found to have left hemiplegia, garbled speech and gaze deviation to the right. At that time, fingerstick was greater than 300. EMS was called and patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the ED, her FSBGlc was 130 and she was noted to have a DNR/DNI form but this was not signed by the patient. Patient was per ED gurgling and they were concerned regarding her ability to protect her airway. They asked patent several times regarding whether she would want to be intubated and she nodded yes and was following commands and was subsequently intubated after NIHSS performed by me. There was some confusion regarding whether she was on warfarin as there was documentation of an INR goal on one sheet but not on her medications. The ED called the nursing home and they said that she was on warfarin and attempted to reach her primary care doctor and health care proxy but eventually the covering doctor was reached and had never seen the patient. She was transiently hypotensive in the CT scanner to SBP 70s briefly and she was started on neosynephrine. She had a severe right MCA syndrome and concern was for ischaemic vs hemorrhagic stroke but CT showed signs in keeping with ischaemia. There was unfortunately a delay in giving tPA due to confusion about whether she was on warfarin and once INR returned back as normal 1.1, tPA was administered. She is currently intubated and sedated - propofol was changed to fentanyl/midazolam given hypotension. Given mental status, not able to obtain full ROS but nodded to being asked about having a headache and did note that she could not see on the left side. She was speaking and able to be easily understood but dysarthric. She was not tachypneic or in respiratory distress. Past Medical History: - AF on coumadin, it was held at the end of [**6-/2197**] given patient's hematoma with her cardiac cath. - HTN - HLD - macular degeneration - multinodular goiter - CAD s/p MI and BMS placement in RCA at [**Hospital1 2025**] [**5-/2197**]; also has significant LAD lesion but was not treated as it was not the culprit lesion - On po vancomycin ? c difficile Social History: The patient presented from a nursing home after discharge from [**Hospital1 2025**] yesterday. Per ED staff had relayed that patientis normally A+Ox3 at baseline and ambulatory. Patient is originally from [**Country 5976**] and reported to have practiced as a lawyer, no family members and never married.

Matched elevated mean transit time and decreased cerebral blood volume in the right MCA territory, indicating a large infarct without significant ischemic penumbra. No acute hemorrhage. 2. Approximately 50% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery. Mild, less than 40% stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery. Mild stenosis at the origin of the dominant left vertebral artery. 3. Multifocal intracranial atherosclerosis involving the anterior and posterior circulation, as detailed above. 4. Large multinodular thyroid, with massive enlargement of the left lobe which extends into the mediastinum, with associated rightward tracheal deviation. If this was not previously evaluated, then outpatient son[**Name (NI) 867**] is recommended in the first instance, when the patient is stable, though son[**Name (NI) 867**] would not be able to visualize the mediastinal component. ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. No cardiac source of embolus other than atrial fibrillation found. MRI/MRA [**2197-7-28**]: 1. Acute infarction of the right MCA territory affecting a wide region of right hemispheric cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, with additional involvement of the caudate, putamen, and possibly globus pallidus. 2. Technically limited MRA with lack of flow beyond the right M1 branch of the MCA and poor filling of the distal branches beyond this location. Head CT [**2197-8-4**]: 1. Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation at right insular ribbon as well as hypodensity in the right lentiform nucleus, consistent with patient's known right MCA stroke. 2. No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or new evolving territorial infarction. 3. Periventricular white matter hypodensities, sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease, are unchanged. *** EEG: [**2197-8-4**]: FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: The background activity on the right hemisphere showed near continuous slowing mostly in [**12-30**] Hz delta intermixed with 5-7 Hz theta. But, the background on the left hemisphere was predominantly [**4-3**] Hz theta often intermixed with 8 hz alpha and [**12-30**] Hz delta. ABNORMALITY #2: There were occasional left temporal sharp waves with negative phase reversal at T3-T5 electrodes. ABNORMALITY #3: There were occasional burst of generalized slowing in 1 Hz delta frequency lasting 2-4 seconds. ABNORMALITY #4: There were occasional generalized blunted sharp waves often with triphasic morphology. BACKGROUND: As above. HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed due to a recent history of stroke. INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Photic stimulation was done with no activation of the study. SLEEP: The patient remained awake during the study. CARDIAC MONITOR: A single EKG channel showed an irregularly irregular rhythm with an average rate of 60-90 bpm. IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG because the background activity was asymmetric with near continuous delta slowing intermixed with some theta on the right hemisphere but the left hemisphere had predominant theta activity admixed with some 8 Hz alpha and [**12-30**] Hz delta activity. There were occasional left temporal sharp waves with negative phase reversal at T3/T5 electrodes, suggestive of potential epileptogenic cortex in the same area. There was occasional generalized burst of delta slowing and generalized blunted often with triphasic morphology. [**2197-8-2**]: CONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: The recording begins at 7:01 a.m. Background demonstrated a [**3-3**] Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is an amplitude asymmetry with lower amplitudes seen throughout on the right. Fairly frequent generalized blunted sharp and slow triphasic waves were observed. Again seen were left temporal discharges with phase reverals noted at T3-T5, occasionally followed by a slow wave and, at times, occurring in brief runs in a periodic or pseudoperiodic manner. Intermittently isolated sharp and slow wave discharges were seen more broadly over left hemisphere or in a more generalized pattern. No clinical correlate seen on video with epileptiform activity. There were also less frequent bursts of sharp and slow wave generalized discharges seen throughout the recording with, at times, more broad-based blunted sharp features more characteristic of triphasic waves. SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Multiple files were recorded for abnormalities described above. Several files also contained, muscle, movement, electrode artifact. SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Multiple files were recorded. No clear clinical or electrographic seizures were observed in these files. Several files did contain movement, electrode artifact and abnormalities noted above. PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There was one pushbutton activation at 18:58. No clear clinical or electrographic seizure activity present at this time. The patient can be seen lying in bed with eyes closed, no adventitious movements noted and no significant changes noted on EEG. SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to sleep with no additional findings. No normal sleep cycles observed. CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm between 50-80 bpm. IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured one pushbutton activation. No clinical or electrographic seizures were recorded. Background ryhthms during wakefulness were slowed and a voltage asymmetry was noted throughout the study with rightsided ampitude lower than left. Focal left temporal discharges in isolation and in brief runs, as well as intermittent generalized discharges, were observed on this day's recording. This EEG continues to demonstrate a moderate encephalopathy with diffuse slowing and with superimposed epileptiform activity. The amplitude asymmetry likely reflects a structural lesion on the right. The more pronounced focal discharges on the left are suggestive of an area of potential epileptogenesis. [**2197-8-2**]: CONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: The recording begins at 11:37. Background during the most awake portions of recording demonstrated a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm on left and 5 Hz on right. There is an amplitude asymmetry with lower amplitudes seen throughout on the right. Multifocal epileptiform sharp discharges were seen in left temporal, parietal, and right central and temporal regions. These were most frequently seen in left temporal regions with phase reverals noted at T3-T5, occasionally followed by a slow wave, and at times occurring in brief runs. No clinical correlate seen on video. There were also less frequent bursts of sharp and slow wave generalized discharges seen throughout the recording with, at times, more broad-based blunted sharp features more characteristic of triphasic waves. SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Multiple files were recorded for abnormalities described above. Several files also contained, muscle, movement, and electrode artifact. SEIZURE DETEECION PROGRAMS: Multiple files were recorded. No clear clinical or electrographic seizures were observed in these files. Several files did contain movement, electrode artifact. PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no pushbutton activations. SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to sleep with no additional findings. CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm between 50-70 bpm. IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. No clinical or electrographic seizures were recorded. Background rhythms during wakefulness were slowed and a voltage asymmetry was noted throughout the study with rightsided amplitude lower than left. Multifocal discharges, most prominent in left temporal regiona as well as intermittent generalized discharges, were observed on this day's recording. This EEG demonstrates a moderate encephalopathy with superimposed epileptiform activity. The amplitude asymmetry likely reflects a structural lesion on the right. The more pronounced focal discharges on the left are suggestive of an area of potential epileptogenesis. *** MICROBIOLOGY: [**2197-8-9**] UA: moderate leukesterase, 31 WBC and few bacteria.

[] Patient has fluctuating level of arousal, with question of frontotemporal dementia given history and imaging, but unable to diagnose at this time. ================================== 82F with PMH of AF previously on coumadin, CAD s/p MI in [**5-/2197**] with BMS stent placed, HTN and HLD who present with acute onset severe right MCA syndrome from rehab. Patient had been just discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] where she was hospitalized for an MI requiring cardiac catheterization and BMS stent placement to RCA. The hospital course at [**Hospital1 2025**] was complicated by groin hematoma from cardiac cath requiring intubation and transfusion. She was taken off coumadin during this hospitalization given her active bleeding. Her hospital course was further complicated by decreased level of arousal, prompting neurological evaluation with head CT, MRI and EEG. CT and MRI did not show acute strokes, and EEG showed some GPEDs which were not treated. Patient eventually woke up and the episode was attributed to sedating medications (with intubation, and also received some antipsychotics for agitation). Here, found to have large R MCA infarct, received tPA in the ED and intubated for decreased level of arousal and need for airway protection. She was monitored in the ICU and transferred to the floor. The hospital course here was also complicated by decreased level of arousal, and EEG here showed bilateral spikes but no electrographic seizures. She was started on amantadine to help with awakefulness. #NEURO: Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] may have some paranoia at baseline but has never had formal diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia or other behavioral variant of dementia. However, given the history of fluctuating level of alertness during these hospitalizations and given her imaging with significant brain atrophy, it is possible that she has some underlying dementia that become exacerbated with these stressors. After her prolonged hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2025**] as above (for MI c/b hematoma), she was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**]. She had been there for 1 day when she developed new left hemiplegia with garbled speech and gaze deviation to the right, and brought into [**Hospital1 18**] ED. She was found to have a large area of signs of early ischemia on the non contrast head CT. After contrast, the area of hypodensity became more pronounced and involved the entire right MCA territory. Given the finding on her imaging and as she presented within three hours of last normal, it was decided to give her IV tPA. She was felt to be not protecting her airway by ED and was intubated just after NIHSS performed. Post intubation she had significant hypotension and was rapidly put on pressor support with neosynephrine. She was given tPA, still within 3 hours after last known normal, but about 65 minutes after presenting to the ED, the delay was due to her almost coding in the CT scanner. 24 hours after TPA she became able to move all her limbs. F/u MRI MRA were positive for right MCA territory ischemic infarct. She was evaluated by speech/swallow, physical therapy and occupational therapy. She did pass s/s evaluation in the ICU with modified diet of pureed solids and nectar thick liquid, however, her hospital stay was complicated by decreased and fluctuating level of arousal which made feeding difficult. She had an NG tube placed for tube feeding given the poor caloric intake. EEG was done to rule out seizures as a cause of her mental status, and though it showed bilateral spikes, there was no electrographic seizures noted. She was started on amantadine to help with her level of arousal with some improvement. # CV: patient with known atrial fibrillation, monitored on telemetry which showed atrial fibrillation but rate controlled. Some of her antihypertensives were held in the setting of acute stroke, but they were restarted with goal normotension. If her blood pressure becomes more elevated, lisinopril can be increased to 20 mg daily (which was her home dose). She was initially anticoagulated with coumadin with aspirin bridge, but coumadin was held and she was started on lovenox bridge as there was thought of PEG tube. However, as she is tolerating PO intake better, will restart coumadin with lovenox bridge. # PULM: Intubated in the ED, extubated successfully in the ICU. No respiratory issues afterwards. # ID: completed course of ceftriaxone for UTI (coag negative staph). No further leukocytosis or fevers. Also had history of c diff treated with oral vancomycin, which was completed during this hospitalization. Repeat c diff toxin was negative. On [**2197-8-9**], found to have difficulty urinating, and UA showed leukesterase, WBC and bacteria, started on 3 day course of Bactrim. # HEME: In the ICU, she also developed drop in H/H, so Coumadin and Plavix was held and CT of abd/pelvis was performed to rule out retroperitoneal hematoma. Fecal occult blood result came back positive. She received 1 unit of PRBCs and her hematocrit remained stable afterwards. # Renal: Had [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr of 1.5 on admission, but creatinine improved throughout the hospitalization. # FEN: passed speech/swallow evaluation on [**2197-7-28**], on pureed solid and nectar thick liquid.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **], It was a pleasure to take care of you at [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted to the hospital because you had a stroke. You were given tPA (clot dissolving medication) and was monitored in the ICU. You were restarted on coumadin during this hospitalization because the atrial fibrillation is the most likely cause of your stroke.

Blunting of right CPA. [**2115-8-27**] CXR: INDICATIONS: Hypoxia, increasing shortness of breath. PORTABLE AP CHEST AT 1610: Comparison is made to the study from six hours earlier. Heart size remains at the upper limits of normal. There is minimal pulmonary, vascular engorgement, but overall, the appearance is improved since the study from six hours earlier. There are no focal consolidations. [**2115-8-31**] CXR: Triangular opacity in the right suprahilar lung is probably atelectasis. Lungs are clear otherwise. Small bilateral pleural effusions layer posteriorly. Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. There is no retrosternal hematoma or displaced rib fracture. Configuration of the chest suggests [**Month/Day/Year 2182**]. EKG on admission: Rate 96 [**Doctor First Name **], regular. Normal axis, normal intervals. LAA. LVH by voltage criteria. Q in III (old), non-specific ST changes in anterior leads (old versus [**2115-7-24**]) EKG on discharge: Sinus rhythm Lateral ST changes are nonspecific Since previous tracing of [**2115-8-30**], no significant change ******************** Relevant studies in hospital: [**2115-8-29**] ECHO: LVEF low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No AR, no AS. (2+) MR, (2+) TR. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo female with MMP including ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF, severe MR, and [**Month/Day/Year 2182**], admitted with SOB in setting of missed HD [**2-20**] clotted AV graft, as well as supratherapeutic INR. Transfusion of FFP was initiated in the ED to reverse her coagulopathy and plan for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement. Unfortunately, she developed worsening hypoxemia with volume administration, and was placed on BiPAP and admitted to the ICU for volume overload and respiratory distress. In the ICU, she developed worsening respiratory distress, and was intubated emergently on [**2115-8-27**] at 20:10, with succinylcholine administration for induction. Shortly after intubation, she went into PEA arrest. 1) PEA arrest: Etiology of PEA arrest attributed to hyperkalemia, with exacerbation following succinylcholine administration. She was resuscitated according to the ACLS algorithms for PEA/asystole/pulseless VT, shocked twice (200 joules and 360 joules)and concomitantly repeatedly treated for hyperkalemia. Potassium during code 6.9, after therapy. She recovered a perfusing normal sinus rhythm after about 30 minutes of resuscitation. EKG post code unchanged. She was started on a dopamine drip for hypotension, which was slowly weaned off on [**8-29**]. An echo was obtained on [**8-29**], which revealed a stable EF at 50%, 2+ MR (improved versus [**6-/2115**]) and moderate PA HTN (old). She was transferred from the ICU to the floor and remained hemodynamically stable with no neurologic deficits. Significant pain in chest from chest compressions, but chest x-ray after code showed no evidence of PNX, hemothorax, rib fracture. Supportive management with Dilaudid PO and oxycontin. Of note, previous bleeding with Ibuprofen (history of acquired factor VII deficiency, s/p Rx). Avoided Tylenol [**2-20**] transaminitis. Electrolytes were monitored and she received HD QOD. 2) Respiratory failure: Attributed to fluid overload in the setting of missed hemodialysis [**2-20**] clotted AV graft and fluid administration +/- [**Month/Day (2) 2182**]. She was 4 kg above dry weight at the time of admission to the ICU. She was initially placed on BiPAP, then emergently intubated given worsening respiratory distress. Renal was called emergently following PEA arrest, and she was emergently dialyzed on [**8-27**]. She was further dialyzed on [**8-28**] with removal of 3 additional kg, and was succesfully extubated on [**8-28**]. She has been stable from a respiratory standpoint since then. She was continued on her chronic out-patient dose of Prednisone 20 mg PO QD and MDIs. Post-arrest, she was empirically started on Levofloxacin and Clindamycin (started on [**8-29**]) for coverage of ? aspiration pneumonia or tracheobronchitis given new sputum production. CXR, however, negative for infiltrate. Sputum grew GPC, GNR, pseudomonas, but patient has had psuedomonas in past and is likely colonized. She completed a 7 day course of antibiotics but remained afebrile, WBC count at baseline, with no evidence of PNA on any CXR's. 3) ESRD on HD: As above. Initial placement of dialysis access deferred given supratherapeutic INR, but eventually placed emergently following arrest (cordis line placed during code changed over wire and dialysis cath placed). She was emergently dialyzed on [**8-27**] at night, then again on [**7-7**], [**9-1**], [**9-3**]. LUE AV graft thrombectomy on [**8-30**] in PM, at which time she was transferred to the floor. Her potassium remained stable and she was given EPO and paricalcitol at dialysis. Her phosphate was chronically elevated, but once TUMS were changed to be given with meals, the phosphate fell to 4-5 range. 4) CAD: She was ruled out for MI on admission with serial cardiac enzymes. EKG pre and post arrest unchanged. Cardiac enzymes not trended post chest compresssions. ASA, isordil, BB, and Lisinopril held throughout admission. WILL RESTART BB, ASA, ISORDIL, AND ACE I ON DAY OF DISCHARGE, AS PATIENT WAS ON ALL OF THESE MEDICATIONS AT ADMISSION TIME. Pulse and BP stable, but please monitor at rehab. 5) Coagulopathy: INR 6.8 on admission. She was given 1 [**1-20**] units of FFP, stopped in the setting of respiratory failure. Vitamin K given on [**8-29**], and INR down to 2.3 on [**8-30**]. Heparin IV restarted after thrombectomy for RLE DVT. Coumadin restarted at same time, initially at 7.5 mg. She reached therapeutic level quickly so dose was decreased to 5 mg and then 2.5 mg. INR on discharge 2.1, with goal [**2-21**]. 6) DM type 2: Kept on [**1-20**] NPH (12 units QAM) and RISS. Once patient started eating again, sugars increased. Will DC on 18 units in a.m. and ask rehabilitation facility to monitor closely. Patient was on ISS while inpatient. 7) HIV: On HAART. Last CD4 well above 200. 8) FEN: Initially NPO, advanced to [**Doctor First Name **]/heart healthy diet/renal diet. Patient initially had some difficulty eating as she felt nauseated and vomited up food. Thought to be due to pain meds. By the time of discharge the patient was keeping most foods down. Patient was seen by nutrition and it was determine that she was at nutrition risk. Patient was drinking one can of Nepro per day and was encouraged to increase to two on the day of discharge. 9) Transaminitis: LFT's transiently rose in setting of shock liver, but returned to baseline by discharge with no intervention needed. 10) Ppx: Maintained on heparin and coumadin. Elevate HOB. PPI. Bowel regimen. 11) Access: Initially right EJ and RUE 20-gauge peripheral IV. Left femoral cordis placed during arrest, changed over wire for temporary dialysis catheter, removed on [**8-30**]). Given 1 dose of Vancomycin prophylactically on [**8-29**] given dirty line still in place, but d/c'd on [**8-30**]. Of note, attempt to place right groin femoral line during code resulted in arterial puncture. Small hematoma noted, no bruit. U/S done on wrong side, not repeated. Thrombectomy performed and original AV graft used thereafter for HD. 12) Code: Full. Has been Discussed with patient.

Imaging: . EKG [**2106-9-28**]: Sinus rhythm with a ventricular premature beat. Possible inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Poor R wave progression. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2106-9-4**] ventricular premature beat is new. . CXR [**2106-9-28**]: Appropriately positioned right IJ central venous catheter. No evidence of complication. . CT abdomen/pelvis (non-contrast) [**2106-9-28**]: 1. Findings consistent with acute epiploic appendagitis along the mid descending [**Month/Day/Year 499**]. Within the limitations of a non-contrast study, no evidence of colitis. 2. Multiple healed rib fractures of the visualized right lower ribs which are new since the since the [**2105-8-18**] study. However, no acute fractures identified. . Left foot (3 views) [**2106-10-5**]: No fracture or dislocation detected. Brief Hospital Course: 67F with CAD, DM2, CKD, Crohn's, pancreatic insufficiency, and muliple urinary tract infections presents from rehab with complaints of fever and hypotension. . # Septic shock: The patient presented from rehab with fever, altered mental status and hypotension. She was found to have SBPs in the 70s refractory to 3L IVF boluses and requiring levophed gtt to maintain MAPs >60. Fever was documented at up to 103. Wbc was 14 on presentation, with creatinine 2.6 (up from baseline 1.4). . The source of infection was unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] cultures were negative. Urine culture from rehab grew 10-30K GPCs (never speciated). CXR was unremarkable. CT abdomen/pelvis showed only epiploic appendigitis. C. diff toxin and PCR were negative. Nonetheless, the patient was presumed to have a GI or GU source of infection, and was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole). Antibiotics were subsequently narrowed to ceftriaxone and metronidazole. The patient was discharged on cefpodoxime and metronidazole, with a plan to complete a 14-day course of antibiotics on [**2106-10-11**]. The patient was instructed to resume taking her prophylactic dose of cipro (which she takes twice daily for Crohn's) when her course of cefpodoxime and metronidazole is complete. . For the patient's hypotension, diuretics were held, and the patient was treated with IV fluids and norepinephrine. As her condition improved, she was weaned off of pressors, and called out of the ICU. On the medical floor, her [**Date Range **] pressure remained stable, and torsemide was restarted but then stopped in the setting of ongoing diarrhea. The patient was discharged off of torsemide. She was instructed to monitor her weight and discuss the medication change with her PCP. . # Acute on chronic kidney injury: The pt presented with Cr 2.6 up from 1.4. Her increased Cr likely represented a prerenal state in the setting of diarrhea, diuresis, and septic shock. The patient's creatinine improved with fluid resuscitation and treatment of her sepsis, and was 1.2 at the time of discharge. . # Altered mental status: The patient was confused on admission due to hypotension and infection. Her mental status returned to [**Location 213**] with normalization of her hemodynamics and treatment of her sepsis. . # Diarrhea: The patient had persistent watery, guaiac-negative diarrhea. The differential diagnosis included antibiotic induced diarrhea, infectious diarrhea, C. diff, Crohn's, and pancreatic insuffiency. CT abdomen pelvis showed only epiploic appendigitis. The patient received pancreatic enzyme supplementation without any effect on her diarrhea. C. diff toxin was repeatly negative, as was C. diff PCR. Once the C. diff PCR came back negative, the patient was started on loperamide, with marked improvement in her diarrhea. . # Chronic Anemia: The patient presented with hematocrit 29.1. Her hematocrit remained stable throughout her admission. Her diarrhea was guaiac-negative. . # Coronary artery disease: The patient has known single-vessel disease and is s/p RCA w/ bare metal stent on [**2102-2-2**]. [**Date Range **] 325mg daily was continued. The patient had a single episode of atypical chest pain on the evening of [**2106-10-5**], without any EKG changes or enzyme elevations. This episode was thought to be gastrointestinal rather than cardiac in etiology. . # Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (Recent ECHO [**8-19**], EF 45-50%): The patient was felt to be hypovolemic on admission, so diuretics and carvedilol were initially held. Carvedilol and torsemide were restarted, but then torsemide was stopped in the setting of persistent diarrhea. The patient was discharged off of torsemide, with the instruction to follow up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2106-10-11**], at which time restarting torsemide should be considered. . # Crohn's Disease: The patient has a history of pancolitis w/o small bowel involvement. CT of the abdomen and pelvis were notable only for epiploic appendigitis. The patient's diarrhea was thought to be unrelated to Crohn's. Mesalamine was continued. . # Diabetes mellitus, type II, on insulin: The patient was treated with Lantus and a Humalog insulin sliding scale, with good glycemic control. She was discharged on her pre-admission regimen of Lantus 40 units at bedtime. . # GERD: Continued [**Hospital1 **] omeprazole. The patient had a single episode of chest discomfort on the evening of [**10-5**] which was likely related to GERD. . # Chronic pain: The patient was discharged on oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **], gabapentin 600 mg [**Hospital1 **], and lidoderm patch. She requested a prescription for oxycontin at the time of discharge. The inpatient team spoke with the patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who confirmed it was okay to give the patient enough oxycontin to last until her follow-up appointment. The patient was warned not to drive or participate in other hazardous activities while on oxycontin. . # Chronic pancreatitis: The patient continued pancreatic enzyme supplementation. . # Toe pain: The patient stubbed her left toe. This was evaluated with x-rays which were negative for fracture. . # Code status: Full code . # Transitional issues: 1. A stool culture was pending at the time of discharge. 2. The patient was discharged off of torsemide. Consideration should be given to restarting this. 3. The patient will complete her course of cefpodoxime and metronidazole on [**2106-10-11**], at which time she should resume cipro, which she takes for Crohn's disease.

Service: PROCEDURE: Ileostomy take down. HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian lady who is status post kidney-pancreas transplant with subsequent failure of kidney transplant due to torsion and a kidney retransplantation approximately one year prior to this admission. She also had a recent event of subtotal colectomy for diffused colitis of unspecific etiology. She had a recent admission for partial small bowel obstruction, which resolved with conservative therapy. She is now readmitted with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes, end-stage renal disease, coronary artery disease, legally blind, hypertension, gastroparesis, asthma, partial strokes, small bowel obstruction, toxic megacolon, status post kidney and pancreas transplant in [**2-22**], kidney retransplant in [**2-23**], ventral hernia repair, PD catheter placement, coronary artery bypass graft in [**2126**], and subtotal colectomy with ileostomy in [**10-26**]. MEDICATIONS: 1. Protonix 2. Prednisone. 3. Reglan 4. Imuran. 5. Ambien. 6. Norvasc. 7. Tacrolimus. 8. Lopressor. 9. Sodium bicarbonate. 10. Bactrim. 11. Loperamide. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is alert and oriented. Blood pressure was 130/70, heart rate was 98, and she was afebrile. Head and neck exam was unremarkable. Chest was clear to auscultation. Heart sounds were normal. Her abdomen was soft and moderately distended with no tenderness. Of note, on digital exam of the ileostomy there was a tightness of the fascia. HOSPITAL COURSE: She was admitted with partial bowel obstruction and a nasogastric tube was placed and IV hydration started. An abdominal x-ray showed some distended small bowel loops. Her abdomen remained soft and nontender. During this admission, we decided, as she was over two months out from her colectomy, to take down the ileostomy and restore bowel continuity. She was, therefore, taken to the operating room after appropriate hydration and an ileostomy take down and ileorectal anastomosis performed without difficulty. She developed some oliguria postoperatively and required a short stay in the intensive care unit. Subsequent to that, she made a good recovery and had early return of bowel function and tolerated a diet. She was discharged home by one week postoperatively in a stable condition. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Partial small bowel obstruction. Type I diabetes, status post kidney-pancreas transplantation. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: She is to resume her routine immunosuppressant medications per the transplant center. FOLLOW UP: In the Transplant Center.

See operative note for details, in summary he had: Aortic valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 68430**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical mechanical Regent valve. His bypass time was 129 minutes with a crossclamp of 106 minutes. He tolerated the operation well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition. He weaned and extubated the night of surgery. All tubes lines and drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocol. On POD1 coumadin was begun for the mechanical valve and he was transferred to the stepdown floor for continued care. He was started on diuretics as well as beta blockade and an ACE inhibitor for BP control. He went into rapid atrial fibrillation on POD #2, he transferred back to the ICU for care and was given amiodarone, beta blockade and calcium channel blockers. After which he converted to sinus rhythm. He was transferred back to the stepdown floor on POD #4, Physical Therapy was consulted for mobility. He did develop some serous sternal drainage on POD 5 for which he was treated with IV cefazolin. The remainder of his hospital course was uneventful. Although he still had slight drainage without any sign of infection on POD 14, Mr. [**Known lastname 49957**] wanted to go home against medical advice. Visiting nursing was arranged and follow-up appointments were advised. Arrangements for anticoagulation regulation were made.
