# RAG Model for Healthcare

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model developed using LangChain and OpenAI embeddings. The model is designed to provide contextually relevant responses from the MIMIC dataset, enhancing healthcare applications' capability to retrieve and generate meaningful information.

## 🚀 Features

- **Contextual Responses:** Utilizes OpenAI embeddings to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers.
- **Scalable Pipeline:** Implements a text processing pipeline with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for efficient document chunking.
- **Optimized Retrieval:** Enhances information retrieval efficiency and reduces response latency through vector storage using Pinecone.
- **Advanced Question-Answering:** Integrates cosine similarity-based vector searches for improved response quality.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI**
- **Pinecone**
- **Python**
- **MIMIC Dataset**
